Exporting Annotations 
======================

Newly created or edited map annotations (excluding vectors) can be exported to a text file through the file menu. The exported file can then be included in a scenario and saved for later use. 

   .. note:: When exporting an edited annotation back to the original scenario, it may be necessary to remove the original annotation definition to avoid having duplicates.
