* **(2.7.3)** Corrected an issue where an open :doc:`Satellite Tether View<../wkf_plugin/wk_satellite_tether_view>` for a platform that is then removed could lead to a crash, either shortly thereafter if other platforms were being tracked, or when the user attempts to open the context menu. *(AFSIM-1158)*
