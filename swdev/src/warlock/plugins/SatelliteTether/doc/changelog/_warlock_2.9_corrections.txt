* Corrected an issue where :class:`WsfDraw` geometries are rendered behind the Earth when using a :doc:`Satellite Tether View<../wkf_plugin/wk_satellite_tether_view>`. (:issue:`AFSIM-989`)
* Removed potential instability when adding tracks to a :doc:`Satellite Tether View<../wkf_plugin/wk_satellite_tether_view>`. (:issue:`AFSIM-1055`)
* Corrected an issue where an open :doc:`Satellite Tether View<../wkf_plugin/wk_satellite_tether_view>` for a platform that is then removed could lead to a crash, either shortly thereafter if other platforms were being tracked, or when the user attempts to open the context menu. (:issue:`AFSIM-1158`)
* Corrected an issue where the relative orbit trace for a tracked platform in an open :doc:`Satellite Tether View<../wkf_plugin/wk_satellite_tether_view>` might not update frequently enough during non-real-time operations. (:issue:`AFSIM-407`)
