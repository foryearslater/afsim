.. image:: ../images/wk_ApplicationLauncher.png

The :doc:`../warlock` Application Launcher provides a toolbar to open scenarios in other AFSIM applications.

By clicking on the associated icon on the toolbar, a user can open the following applications:

* :doc:`../wizard` - An IDE used to edit the scenario. Please note that any changes to the scenario made in Wizard will not be reflected on Warlock's graphical interface unless the scenario is reloaded.
* :doc:`../mystic` - A visualization tool used to view an affiliated AFSIM event recording file (.aer).
