* Corrected an issue preventing exclusion zones within :doc:`zone sets<../zone_set>` from being displayed in Warlock and Mystic. (:issue:`AFSIM-1115`)
* The Script Arguments pop-up window associated with the :doc:`Dialog Builder<../wkf_plugin/wk_dialog_builder>` will now execute the specified script when the enter key is pressed. The user is no longer required to use the mouse to click the execute button.
* Corrected an issue that caused a global relative :command:`zone` to appear in an unsuitable default location when no :command:`zone.position` was defined. (:issue:`AFSIM-1193`)
* Corrected an issue where :command:`zones<zone>` with :command:`reference platforms<zone.reference_platform>` would not follow their platform during simulation in Warlock and Mystic. (:issue:`AFSIM-1333`)
* Corrected the sign of range rate that is reflected in the :doc:`RelativeGeometry <../wkf_plugin/wk_relative_geometry>` plugin. (:issue:`AFSIM-1754`)
