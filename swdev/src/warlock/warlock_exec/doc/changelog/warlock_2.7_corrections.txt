* **(2.7.2)** Fixed issue where certain large scenarios could become unresponsive while loading. *(AFSIM-1028)*
* Fixed a range check that was causing sensor volume to be drawn narrow with azimuth ranges from -180 to 180. *(Issue #2232)*
* Added geometry to the termination surface of circular fields of view to make them more spherical. *(AFSIM-290)*
* Corrected an issue where the :doc:`Chat<../wkf_plugin/wk_chat>` would clear all joined channels when loading a configuration file. *(Issue #1591)*
* Fixed a crash that occurred when running :doc:`Astrolabe<../wkf_plugin/wk_astrolabe>`'s Verify command on a platform with an external include in its body. *(Issue #1672)*
* Corrected an issue where updating any sensor visibility within :doc:`Platform Options<../warlock_platform_options>` would set all unchanged sensors' visibilities to true *(Issue #2186)*.
* Corrected an issue where the '-console' command line argument would not work when running from a windows command line. *(Issue #2198)*
* Corrected an issue where :class:`WsfDraw` ellipsoids would not have the appropriate color. *(Issue #2206)*
* Resolved a crash that occurs when loading a second scenario file that includes :command:`comm` devices. *(Issue #2226)*
* Resolved an unpredictable crash that can occur due to threading issues. *(Issue #2258)*
* Fixed an issue that allowed unintentional panning and zooming of a :doc:`Head Up View<../wkf_plugin/wk_head_up_view>`. *(Issue #2260)*
* Corrected an issue in :doc:`Simulation Logs<../wkf_plugin/wk_simulation_log>` where error popups would appear when not enabled. *(Issue #2302)*
* Corrected an issue where :doc:`visibility<../wkf_plugin/wk_visibility>` would not update on config reload if -lock_side is specified on the :doc:`Command Line<../warlock_command_line>`. *(Issue #2389)*
* Fixed an issue where Warlock can fail to rerun a scenario that defines an :command:`_.aux_data` block. *(Issue #2437)*
* Corrected an issue where a jammer could cause a crash when publishing to the event-pipe. *(Issue #2471)*
* Corrected an issue where :command:`fuel` related values would appear incorrectly in :doc:`Platform Details<../wkf_plugin/wk_platform_data>`. *(Issue #2535)*
* Fixed a crash that occurred when the simulation was reset after making certain zones visible within the :doc:`Zone Browser<../wkf_plugin/wk_zone_browser>`. *(Issue #2552)*
