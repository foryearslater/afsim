* Updated :doc:`Dialog Builder<../wkf_plugin/wk_dialog_builder>` to support calling scripts with parameter types of WsfSensor, WsfWeapon, and WsfComm, as well as arrays of these types. (:issue:`AFSIM-1103`)
* Scenarios can now be loaded by dragging/dropping files into the |MAP_DISPLAY_LINK|. (:issue:`AFSIM-1162`)
* Added a sub-menu, 'Scripts', that provides access to :doc:`Dialog Builder<../wkf_plugin/wk_dialog_builder>` custom scripts from the platform context menu. Additionally, a new option has been added in the Script Builder to clamp platform selection when executing a custom script. (:issue:`AFSIM-1168`)
* :doc:`Dialog Builder<../wkf_plugin/wk_dialog_builder>` script input prompts will now be consolidated into a dockable widget. The dock widget will open whenever a script prompt is generated or it can be manually opened through the :doc:`View Menu<../warlock_view_menu>`. (:issue:`AFSIM-1172`)
* Added track ID labels to tracks. This can be enabled/disabled from the track preferences. (:issue:`AFSIM-1383`)
* Improved error messages when the simulation crashes. (:issue:`AFSIM-1515`)
