* **(2.3.1)** Fixed crash when using large and negative numbers in `Range Rings <../wkf_plugin/wk_map_annotation.html#range-rings>`_ Properties center radius and additional radii.
* **(ELSZ #57)** Added support for GPUs that cannot compile GLSL 3.0 ES shaders, resulting in missing platform icons.
* **(ELSZ #80)** Corrected the coloration of WsfDraw quads.
* Fixed issue where platforms would not appear on the :doc:`Map Display <../wkf_plugin/wk_map_display>` when restarting a scenario.
* Fixed issue that would cause platforms created using a :command:`WSF_ROAD_MOVER.road_network` to not appear when the simulation started.
* Fixed issue that could create duplicate tether windows on simulation restart.
* Fixed issue that could cause visual parts to start in the wrong state.
* Fixed issue where turning a sensor or mover on from the :doc:`Platform Part Browser <../wkf_plugin/wk_platform_part_browser>` would not turn the part on.
* Warlock will no longer deadlock when changing the run-time multiplier when executing large scenarios.
* Corrected an issue that would in certain circumstances flip (nearly negate the pitch of) a platform.
* Corrected relative heading display for the measurement tool.
* Modified sensor volumes to properly show multiple beams on a given sensor.
* Fixed display issues when using 4k screen resolution.
* The :doc:`DIS Settings <../warlock_pref_simulation>` in Preferences are now disabled after receiving invalid input.
* Corrected altitude display in :doc:`P6DOF data <../wkf_plugin/wk_p6dof_data>` displays.
* Fixed the second Yaw G Load button in the :doc:`P6DOF Autopilot controller <../wkf_plugin/wk_p6dof_tuner>` dialog.
* Fixed issue where Warlock would crash when using "/who" command in the :doc:`Chat <../wkf_plugin/wk_chat>` window when disconnected from a network.
* Fixed issue with UserList size displaying misleading values in the :doc:`Logs and Chat <../wkf_plugin/wk_chat>` view.
* Fixed issue where :doc:`Event Markers <../wkf_plugin/wk_event_marker>` for weapon events without a target were not being shown on the map.
* Modified :doc:`P6DOF Controller plugin <../wkf_plugin/wk_p6dof_controller>` HUD to draw a background rectangle, and use a monospace font for text.
* Fixed issues with velocity vector beta and re-arranged data items in the :doc:`P6DOF Controller <../wkf_plugin/wk_p6dof_controller>` HUD display for better grouping and presentation.
* Fixed issue where platforms with no movers could not be moved via dragging or when the "Instant" option was selected in the Go To Location command on the :doc:`Platform Movement <../wkf_plugin/wk_platform_movement>` window.
* Fixed issue where text with angle brackets was not displayed on the console tab in the :doc:`Chat Window <../wkf_plugin/wk_chat>` plugin.
* Fixed issue where :doc:`Wing Ribbons <../wkf_plugin/wk_platform_history>` were resetting when changing color scheme from Team Color to another option.
* Fixed crash caused by the Sensor Volumes plugin when applying preferences after the simulation completes or a platform with sensor volumes is deleted.
