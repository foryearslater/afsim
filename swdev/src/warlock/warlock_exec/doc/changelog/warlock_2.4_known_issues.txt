* The Video and Screenshot capability fails to capture the openGL windows on some computers.  This appears to be related to the configuration of the computer.
* Fire Weapon commands are not transmitted over XIO to connected sims.  This prevents a user from instructing a remote platform to fire weapons.
* The console window does not appear when using the -console option, if Warlock was launched from a console window.  Works fine if launched via a Windows batch file.
* WsfDraw occasionally does not render all draw commands.  This problem seems related to the similar issue in Results Vis.
* The Sensor Mode indicator within the Platform Part browser may be incorrect when the mode is changed by methods other than through script.
* On Windows, when running Warlock as administrator, the thumbnails buttons that appear when hovering over the Warlock icon on the Window's taskbar do not appear.  Windows Media Player has this same issue so it is likely a Windows OS issue.
* There is a QT issue (QTBUG-7556) when using Windows 7 and NVidia graphics cards where context menus do not show in full screen mode.
* Each time a jamming task is assigned to a platform using the Task Assigner, a new jamming interaction line is drawn on the Map Display, even if the task is identical to a previous task.
* There is one frame of latency between the elevation lines and the rest of the scene.
* Loading of TIFF files on Linux may lead to a crash. This may apply to visual databases and using .tif files as annotation images.
