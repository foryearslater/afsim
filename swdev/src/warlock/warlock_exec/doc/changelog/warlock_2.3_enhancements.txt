* Modified the :doc:`center display <../warlock_central_display>` to accept docking with a drag-and-drop operation.
* :ref:`Plots<Platform_Details-Warlock.Plotting>` can now dock to the center display.
* The :doc:`Script Browser<../wkf_plugin/wk_script_browser>` and :doc:`Dialog Builder<../wkf_plugin/wk_dialog_builder>` both support arrays as input arguments and return types, including arrays of simple types, WsfGeoPoints, WsfTracks, and WsfPlatforms.
* The :doc:`Dialog Builder<../wkf_plugin/wk_dialog_builder>` supports drag and drop functionality for moving buttons when defining the layout of a dialog.  Dialog Builder also supports moving buttons that have an empty name.
* Added the ability to bind script execution to controllers' actions in the :doc:`P6DOF Controller<../wkf_plugin/wk_p6dof_controller>` plugin.
* :doc:`Tracks <../wkf_plugin/wk_tracks>` are now supported across networked simulations.
* :doc:`Interaction lines <../wkf_plugin/wk_interactions>` now arched, to avoid clipping the terrain.
* Created separate pages for the :doc:`Team Visibility<../wkf_pref_team_visibility>` and :doc:`Track Visibility<../wkf_plugin/wk_tracks>` Preferences Options
* Middle-mouse-button drag will now tilt and rotate the map-view camera on the :doc:`Map Display<../wkf_plugin/wk_map_display>`, replacing shift-right-button drag.
* Added smoothing to camera motions when zooming, centering on a platform, or following a :doc:`chat<../wkf_plugin/wk_chat>` link.
* Added a density control to the grid lines in the :doc:`map preferences<../wkf_plugin/wk_map_display>`.
* Made disabled icons more noticeable in the dark theme.
* Added :doc:`P6DOF Tuner <../wkf_plugin/wk_p6dof_tuner>` plugin support to work with Mover Creator.
* Added the ability to restore defaults to a single page or to all pages within :doc:`Preferences <../warlock_preferences>`
* Added a "System Info" dialog to the :doc:`about dialog <../warlock_help>` to display advanced system information.
* Changed the max run speed multiplier from 100x to 1000x real time on the :doc:`Sim Controller<../wkf_plugin/wk_sim_controller>` Clock Speed slider.
* Improved :doc:`P6DOF Controller <../wkf_plugin/wk_p6dof_controller>` plugin HUD colors/contrast for enhanced visibility with background clutter.
* Modified output of :doc:`P6DOF Tuner <../wkf_plugin/wk_p6dof_tuner>` plugin to produce a separate file for vehicle g-load limits.
