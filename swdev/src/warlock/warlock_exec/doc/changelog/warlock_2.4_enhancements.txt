* Improved :doc:`video captures <../wkf_plugin/wk_video_capture>` by using H.264 encoding on Windows platforms.
* Improved the selection highlight on the map to look better and be more tolerant of resolution changes.
* Properly scale vectors to the models' sizes in immersive views.
* Improved the calculation to determine the curvature of interaction lines to minimize the effect when terrain clipping is unlikely.
* Added the ability to display :doc:`vectors <../wkf_plugin/wk_map_annotation>` on the :doc:`Map Display<../wkf_plugin/wk_map_display>`.
* Improved the follow feature in the map view to better support the ECI camera mode, high altitude platforms, and rotations.
* Added a :doc:`look-at<../wkf_plugin/wk_tether_view>` capability to the tether plugin.
* Added the :doc:`Create Platform<../wkf_plugin/wk_create_platform>` plugin, which allows the user to create a new platform instance from an existing platform_type while the simulation is running.
* Added the :doc:`Visual Effects<../wkf_plugin/wk_visual_effects>` plugin, which adds explosions and smoke trails to the :doc:`Map Display<../wkf_plugin/wk_map_display>`.
* Added an option to display or suppress team colors on platform icons in the :doc:`Map Display<../wkf_plugin/wk_map_display>` preferences.
* Improved the :doc:`Weapon Browser <../wkf_plugin/wk_weapon_browser>` plugin to allow for more extensive viewing and firing options.
* Added :doc:`Application Launcher <../wkf_plugin/wk_application_launcher>` plugin to allow users to open Wizard or Mystic from Warlock.
* Added the Warlock :doc:`WsfPrompt<../wkf_plugin/wk_wsfprompt>` plugin, which displays customizable dialogs created from calls to :class:`WsfPrompt` Display methods.
* Added additional settings to customize :doc:`Event Markers<../wkf_plugin/wk_event_marker>` and made text on the tooltip more legible.
* Added a :doc:`Cyber Engagement Browser<../wkf_plugin/wk_cyber_engagement_browser>` plugin, which allows the user to view currently perceived cyber attack or scan events.
* Added a :doc:`Cyber Engagement Controller<../wkf_plugin/wk_cyber_engagement_controller>` plugin, which allows the user to initiate and control cyber attack and scan events.
* Added comment bubbles in the Map Display for the :doc:`Comment<../wkf_plugin/wk_comment>` Plugin.
* Added additional settings to customize :doc:`Tracks<../wkf_plugin/wk_tracks>`.
* The Platform Data display now shows Range, Bearing, and Elevation information for tracks in the Master Track List of a platform.
* A progress bar is displayed while loading scenarios.  This prevents Warlock from appearing like it is frozen.
* Added a :doc:`Zone Browser<../wkf_plugin/wk_zone_browser>` plugin, which allows the user to visualize :doc:`zones <../zone>`. 
* Added platform history options (trace-lines and wing-ribbons) to :doc:`tether views<../wkf_plugin/wk_tether_view>`.
* Location selectors may now select route way-points.
