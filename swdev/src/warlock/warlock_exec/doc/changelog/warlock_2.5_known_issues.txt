* The Video and Screenshot capability fails to capture the openGL windows on some computers.  This appears to be related to the configuration of the computer.
* On Windows, when running |PRODUCT_NAME| as administrator, the thumbnails buttons that appear when hovering over the |PRODUCT_NAME| icon on the Window's taskbar do not appear.  Windows Media Player has this same issue so it is likely a Windows OS issue.
* There is a QT issue (QTBUG-7556) when using Windows 7 and NVidia graphics cards where context menus do not show in full screen mode.
* There is one frame of latency between the elevation lines and the rest of the scene.
* Loading of TIFF files on Linux may lead to a crash. This may apply to visual databases and using .tif files as annotation images.
* The console window does not appear when using the -console option, if Warlock was launched from a console window.  Works fine if launched via a Windows batch file.
