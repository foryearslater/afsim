* Opening and closing multiple Tether Views can lead to a Warlock crash or the Tether dialog showing up empty.
* The Video and Screenshot capability fails to capture the openGL windows on some computers.  This appears to be related to the configuration of the computer.
* Moving dialogs in and out of the central display can lead to issues where the boundaries of the window are lost and the window will appear off the top left corner of the screen.  When this happens it can be difficult to recover the window.  When this occurs with the tether window, and a new tether window is created, it will lead to a crash.
* Tracks and Fire Weapons commands are not transmitted over XIO to connected sims.  This prevents a user from viewing tracks on a remote platform, or instructing a remote platform to fire weapons.
* The console window does not appear when using the -console option, if Warlock was launched from a console window.  Works fine if launched via a Windows batch file.
* WsfDraw occasionally does not render all draw commands.  This problem seems related to the similar issue in Results Vis.
* The Heads Down Display only shows tracks that exist within a track processor, and not tracks in the master track lists.
* The Sensor Mode indicator within the Platform Part browser may be incorrect when the mode is changed by methods other than through script.
* On Windows, when running Warlock as administrator, the thumbnails buttons that appear when hovering over the Warlock icon on the Window's taskbar do not appear.  Windows Media Player has this same issue so it is likely a Windows OS issue.
* Loading large scenario may take a very long time, and cause Warlock to have appeared to deadlock.  Some large scenarios will consume a large amount of memory when loading them.
* When running Windows 32-bit, Warlock will occasionally crash with a bad allocation message. This does not occur on Windows 64-bit or Linux.
