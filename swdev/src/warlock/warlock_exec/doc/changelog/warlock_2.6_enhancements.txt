* Added :doc:`hover info<../wkf_plugin/wk_map_hover_info>` for :doc:`event markers<../wkf_plugin/wk_event_marker>`. *(Issue #1437)*
* Added Mach as a calculated output in |PLATFORM_DETAILS_LINK| and |MAP_HOVER_INFO_LINK|. *(Issue #1440)*
* Added a Delay Route command to :doc:`Platform Movement<../wkf_plugin/wk_platform_movement>`, which causes the mover to turn 180 degrees before returning to the original route after a specified amount of time. *(Issue #1638)*
* Added shortcut keys (default H and G) to the Platform Movement plugin which allow users to quickly issue commands to selected platforms. *(Issue #1644)*
* Added support for model articulation to |TETHER_VIEW_LINK| and |SATELLITE_TETHER_VIEW_LINK| through configuration in :doc:`model definitions<../wkf_model_definitions>`. *(Issue #1655)*
* Items in :doc:`Cursor Info<../wkf_plugin/wk_cursor_info>` can now be dragged onto the :doc:`map<../wkf_plugin/wk_map_display>` to create a data overlay. *(Issue #1658)*
* P6DOF Tuner now uses maximum overshoot, steady-state error, rise time, and settling time when scoring PID performance. *(Issue #1718)*
* P6DOF Tuner uses setpoints for angles and angular rates based on provided vehicle capability limits. *(Issue #1718)*
* The :doc:`Dialog Builder<../wkf_plugin/wk_dialog_builder>` now supports :doc:`keyboard shortcuts<../wkf_pref_shortcuts>` and :doc:`links<../wkf_plugin/wk_chat>` associated with buttons. *(Issue #1766)*
* Track icons can now be set to use domain-specific icons or the icon of the tracked platform. *(Issue #1770)*
* :doc:`WsfDraw<../script/wsfdraw>` layers can now be enabled/disabled in :doc:`tether views<../wkf_plugin/wk_tether_view>` through the right-click menu. *(Issue #1771)* 
* Added MsgUserAction events, generated by user actions taken in Warlock, to :doc:`WsfEventPipe<../event_pipe>`. *(Issue #1815)*
* Aux Data can now be plotted from |PLATFORM_DETAILS_LINK|. *(Issue #1848)*
* Added :doc:`Sensor Projections<../wkf_plugin/wk_projector>` that may be enabled and disabled from the map display. *(Issue #1870)*
* Added an option to disable stacking of certain :doc:`interaction lines<../wkf_plugin/wk_interactions>`. *(Issue #1893)*
* Added a swap button in the :doc:`RelativeGeometry <../wkf_plugin/wk_relative_geometry>` plug-in, allowing the user to swap platforms. *(Issue #1904)*
* Added the :doc:`Team Visibility<../wkf_plugin/wk_visibility>` dialog to allow user to quickly control the visibility of teams in a scenario and combined it with the :doc:`Type Visibility<../wkf_plugin/wk_visibility>` dialog. *(Issue #1905)*
* :command:`Message hop events<observer>` will now trigger communication :doc:`interaction lines<../wkf_plugin/wk_interactions>`. *(Issue #1906)*
* Added a :doc:`Head Up View<../wkf_plugin/wk_head_up_view>` plugin, allowing the viewing of multiple head up views simultaneously. *(Issue #1910)*
* Added a :doc:`Joystick<../wkf_plugin/wk_joystick>` plugin, allowing the user to control platforms using a joystick. *(Issue #1910)*
* Additional internal kinematic and controller states are reset between :doc:`P6DOF Tuner <../wkf_plugin/wk_p6dof_tuner>` evaluations. This produces a cleaner and more consistent platform for assessing autopilot efficacy. *(Issue #2007)*
* Tuned :doc:`interaction lines<../wkf_plugin/wk_interactions>` to minimize curvature at high altitudes. *(Issue #2036)*
