* **(2.3.1)** Updated FFmpeg from 3.3.6 to 4.1 to fix critical vulnerabilities.
* Added the :doc:`Map Annotation <../wkf_plugin/wk_map_annotation>` plugin to allow the addition of points-of-interest, range-rings, and annotations to the map.
* Added the :doc:`Model Viewer <../wkf_plugin/wk_model_viewer>` dialog which allows user to view and edit the visual model used for platforms.
* Added the :doc:`Scoreboard <../wkf_plugin/wk_scoreboard>` dialog so users can track statistics for local weapon performance within the simulation.
* Added the :doc:`Task Assigner <../wkf_plugin/wk_task_assigner>` dialog so that users may issue tasks to platforms on the same command chain over a comm network.
* Added the :doc:`Task Status <../wkf_plugin/wk_task_status>` dialog so that users can see active tasks for the selected platform.
* Added the ability to customize the message that appears when the cursor is hovered over a platform on the :doc:`Map Display <../wkf_plugin/wk_map_display>`.  To modify the information displayed go to Preferences->Map Hover Info.
* Added the ability to monitor when remotely connected simulations are falling behind real-time and act accordingly (status bar update, auto-pause, etc.)
* Added a "Did You Know?" section to the :doc:`Start <../warlock_start_dialog>` dialog.
* Improved run-time performance of Warlock when executing large scenarios with thousands of platforms.  Warlock will no longer deadlock when changing the run-time multiplier when executing large scenarios.
