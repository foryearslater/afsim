* warlock::SimInterfaceBase class and warlock::SimInterfaceT class template now require smart pointers (std::unique_ptr) to add simulation commands and events for message passing between threads.
* wkf::PrefObject and wkf::PrefWidget re-factored to simplify the interfaces and make them less error prone for developers.
* The signals in wkf::UnitsObject have changed. It will now emit a different signal for each unit that changed, instead of one signal to notify that any number of units have changed. This allows an object to be connected to the specified signal of interest and reduces unnecessary notifications.
