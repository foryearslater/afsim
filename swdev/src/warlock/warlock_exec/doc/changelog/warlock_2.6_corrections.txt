* **(2.6.2)** Corrected an issue where a jammer could cause a crash when publishing to the event-pipe. *(Issue #2471)*
* **(2.6.2)** Fixed a crash that occurred when the simulation was reset after making certain zones visible within the :doc:`Zone Browser<../wkf_plugin/wk_zone_browser>`. *(Issue #2552)*
* **(2.6.2)** Fixed a range check that was causing sensor volume to be drawn narrow with azimuth ranges from -180 to 180. *(Issue #2232)*
* **(2.6.2)** Added geometry to the termination surface of circular fields of view to make them more spherical. *(AFSIM-290)*
* **(2.6.2)** Fixed an issue where Warlock can fail to rerun a scenario that defines an :command:`_.aux_data` block. *(Issue #2437)*
* **(2.6.1)** Fixed a crash that occurred when running :doc:`Astrolabe<../wkf_plugin/wk_astrolabe>`'s Verify command on a platform with an external include in its body. *(Issue #1672)*
* **(2.6.1)** Resolved a crash that occurs when loading a second scenario file that includes :command:`comm` devices. *(Issue #2226)*
* **(2.6.1)** Resolved an unpredictable crash that can occur due to threading issues. *(Issue #2258)*
* Fixed a bug that allowed the user to export plot data when the -lock_fileload :doc:`command line<../warlock_command_line>` argument is provided. *(Issue #1341)*
* Fixed issue where :doc:`team visibility<../wkf_pref_team_visibility>` could be overwritten by restoring defaults when -lock_side is specified in the :doc:`command line<../warlock_command_line>`. *(Issue #1630)*
* Fixed bug in :doc:`P6DOF Tuner<../wkf_plugin/wk_p6dof_tuner>` where genetic algorithm populations were improperly initialized. *(Issue #1718)*
* Fixed issue in :doc:`P6DOF Tuner<../wkf_plugin/wk_p6dof_tuner>` where tuned PID values would sometimes not be propagated correctly. *(Issue #1718)*
* Fixed issue where ellipsoids in :class:`WsfDraw` always appear grey when alpha is set to 1. *(Issue #1772)*
* Fixed a crash in :doc:`P6DOF Tuner<../wkf_plugin/wk_p6dof_tuner>` which would occur if a user specified equal maximum and minimum search limits for a controller PID gain (e.g., constraining a gain value to 0). *(Issue 2049)*
* Fixed issue where elliptical :doc:`zones<../wkf_plugin/wk_zone_browser>` were displayed incorrectly. *(Issue #2134)*
* Fixed issue where platforms would not be visible on the :doc:`Platform Browser<../wkf_plugin/wk_platform_browser>`. *(Issue #2138)*
* Fixed issue where :doc:`tracks<../wkf_plugin/wk_tracks>` would not be visible when they should be after changing :doc:`Team Visibility<../wkf_plugin/wk_visibility>`. *(Issue #2144)*
* Adjusted models' wing-tip locations to be more accurate to draw better :doc:`wing-ribbons<../wkf_plugin/wk_platform_history>`. *(Issue #2151)*
