* **(2.5.3)** To address a memory-related issue resulting from the update to Qt 5.12, the method ``wkf::Environment::GetEntityContextMenu`` has been renamed to ``BuildEntityContextMenu`` and its signature changed. *(Issue #2378)*
* **(2.5.2)** Fixed issue which prevented :doc:`P6DOF Tuner <../wkf_plugin/wk_p6dof_tuner>` from initializing properly from Mover Creator without user intervention *(Issue #1845)*
* Fixed issue where Warlock would not build from an installed source unless also built with Wizard. *(ELSZ #234)*
* Fixed issue with :doc:`Weapon Browser <../wkf_plugin/wk_weapon_browser>` always populating track with track 1 and always populating weapon command list with at least 1 command.
* Fixed an issue where :class:`WsfDraw` icons would not show the requested color.
* Fixed issue where weapon data was not being displayed on the :doc:`Platform Details <../wkf_plugin/wk_platform_data>` dialog.
* Fixed issue where the :doc:`Event Marker <../wkf_plugin/wk_event_marker>` preferences would reset the selected icon to a Dot when the user would try to select X for the icon. Also fixed an issue where custom icons would sometimes fail to show up. 
* Fixed issue in :doc:`Map Annotations <../wkf_plugin/wk_map_annotation>` where adding a text annotation to a platform did not remove the symbolic decoration, already attached to that platform, in the :doc:`Platform Browser <../wkf_plugin/wk_platform_browser>`. *(Issue #1505)*
* Fixed issue where modifications to :doc:`preferences <../warlock_preferences>` made by loading :doc:`configurations <../warlock_user_configurations>` from the :doc:`file menu <../warlock_file_menu>` did not immediately take effect.
* Fixed issue where including certain fields (E.g. Index) in :doc:`Map Hover Info <../wkf_plugin/wk_map_hover_info>` prevented information boxes from being displayed. *(Issue #1612)*
* Fixed crash on startup when the :doc:`SimController Toolbar <../wkf_plugin/wk_sim_controller>` was not visible. *(Issue #1706)*
