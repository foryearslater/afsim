* The :doc:`Map Overlay Banner <../wkf_pref_general>` now displays the scenario's classification level, caveats, and trigraphs. The text is controlled via the :command:`classification` command within the scenario. *(ELSZ #98)*
* Added an :doc:`option<../wkf_plugin/wk_map_display>` to display the altitude of a loaded DTED under the mouse cursor. *(Issue #1111)*
* Added an option to allow the user to choose between a camera that rotates with platform heading and one that does not in :doc:`tether view <../wkf_plugin/wk_tether_view>`.
* Added a :doc:`Zone Browser<../wkf_plugin/wk_zone_browser>` plugin, which allows the user to visualize :doc:`zones <../zone>` and :doc:`zone sets <../zone_set>`.
* Added the ability to drag items off of the :doc:`Platform Details<../wkf_plugin/wk_platform_data>`, and onto the :doc:`map<../wkf_plugin/wk_map_display>`, :doc:`tether view<../wkf_plugin/wk_tether_view>`, or :doc:`P6DOF Controller<../wkf_plugin/wk_p6dof_controller>`. *(Issue #1361)*
* Added the :doc:`Orbits<../wkf_plugin/wk_orbits>` plugin, which allows the user to visualize the orbits of space-domain platforms.
* Added a :doc:`Relative Geometry Dialog<../wkf_plugin/wk_relative_geometry>`. *(Issue #1412)*
* Added ability to create a :doc:`Bullseye<../wkf_plugin/wk_map_annotation>` on the Map Display, and show the range and bearing from the Bullseye to the cursor position.
* Added several new types of :doc:`Visual Effects<../wkf_plugin/wk_visual_effects>` that can be displayed in tether views.
* Added an option to zoom at the mouse cursor in the :doc:`Map Display<../wkf_plugin/wk_map_display>`. *(Issue #1519)*
* Added the :doc:`Type Browser<../wkf_plugin/wk_visibility>` which allows the user to filter the visible platform set by platform type.
* Added precision settings to the :doc:`Unit Preferences<../wkf_pref_units>` that control the number of decimal places that will be displayed for units of the specified type. *(Issue #1529)*
* Added a :doc:`Cursor Info <../wkf_plugin/wk_cursor_info>` dialog which shows information about the position of the cursor on the :doc:`Map Display<../wkf_plugin/wk_map_display>` *(Issue #1537)*
* Added the :doc:`Astrolabe<../wkf_plugin/wk_astrolabe>` tool to Warlock, which allows for the injection of orbital mission sequences into running simulations. *(Issue #1416)*
* Added the ability to add :doc:`Map Annotations <../wkf_plugin/wk_map_annotation>` to track icons and points of interest.
* Updated the coast-line vector layer in the :doc:`Map Display<../wkf_plugin/wk_map_display>`. *(Issue #1464)*
* Added a :doc:`Line of sight <../wkf_plugin/wk_terrain_tools>` tool. *(Issue #1471)*
* Added a :doc:`Satellite tether<../wkf_plugin/wk_satellite_tether_view>` which is optimized for high-altitude, and allows for RIC frame trace lines. *(Issue #1513)*
* Added support for drag-to-move for platforms controlled over XIO. *(Issue #1616)*
* Added support in :doc:`Astrolabe<../wkf_plugin/wk_astrolabe>` for the :doc:`change_attitude<../change_attitude>` orbital event. *(Issue #1571)*
* Enhanced HUD support in :doc:`P6DOF Controller plugin <../wkf_plugin/wk_p6dof_controller>` and added a simple, experimental audio support for warning tones. *(Issue #1215)*
