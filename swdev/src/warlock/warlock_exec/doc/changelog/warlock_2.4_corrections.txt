* Fixed issue that prevented Warlock from loading the scenario when the scenario was specified using a relative path. *(ELSZ #82)*
* Removed unsupported waypoint error message when using :command:`route.turn_left` or :command:`route.turn_right` commands within a route. *(ELSZ #83)*
* Fixed crash that could occur after using WsfDraw with references to platforms. *(ELSZ #174)*
* Modified the :doc:`tether views <../wkf_plugin/wk_tether_view>` depth buffer to avoid visual artifacts and terrain clipping at long ranges.
* Fixed an issue where :doc:`video captures <../wkf_plugin/wk_video_capture>` would not properly capture at real-time.
* Fixed icon and text formatting issues for buttons in the :doc:`Warlock Dialog Builder <../wkf_plugin/wk_dialog_builder>`
* Fixed issue where selecting multiple platforms may cause dialogs to update to display a different platform than expected.
* Removed Required PD from sensors in the :doc:`Platform Part Browser <../wkf_plugin/wk_platform_part_browser>`.
* Corrected the representation of range rings, sensor volumes, and orbits on flat maps.
* Corrected an issue where a tether view's camera would be incorrectly placed when the standard view was a flat map.
* Corrected an issue where points of interest would not update when swapping between flat and round maps.
* Fixed issue where sensor volumes that were enabled, were no longer displayed after a reset or restart.
* Fixed crash that occurs when using the up arrow key in the :doc:`chat window <../wkf_plugin/wk_chat>` with no previously executed commands.
* Fixed issue that would cause platform to incorrect appear in the Peers list on the :doc:`Task Assigner<../wkf_plugin/wk_task_assigner>` Dialog.
* Fixed an issue where non-billboarded image based models would not show.
* Warlock :ref:`plot dialogs<Platform_Details-Warlock.Plotting>` will now close upon simulation restart.
* Warlock :doc:`Interactions<../wkf_plugin/wk_interactions>` will now display interaction lines and icons for cyber engagements.
* Improved the performance when selecting platforms.
* Fixed a crash caused by selecting a waypoint of a relative global route in the Route Browser and then selecting another route.
* Deleting a global route by right-clicking on one of its waypoints in the Route Browser will now correctly remove the route from the Map Display.
* Fixed an issue where editing a route in the :doc:`Route Browser<../wkf_plugin/wk_platform_movement>` would update the route immediately before clicking "Apply".
* Return To Route in the :doc:`Platform Movement Browser<../wkf_plugin/wk_platform_movement>` now correctly updates the route for P6DOF Movers.
* Routes for P6DOF Movers now update on the Map Display when the route is changed.
* Fixed issue that prevented tracks on remote platforms from dropping. This only occurred when multiple Warlock instances were networked together.
* Fixed an issue with the visualization of :class:`WsfDraw` commands whose vertices are specified in screen coordinates using methods :method:`WsfDraw.VertexScreen` and :method:`WsfDraw.VertexScreenPlat`.
* Fixed a bug which drew :class:`WsfDraw` points as gray.
