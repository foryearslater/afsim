Grammar Guide - Wizard
----------------------

The WSF grammar format defines the syntax of WSF commands. The grammar is used in Wizard for parsing WSF files. Grammar files already exist for many WSF modules and can be found in .ag files in the 'grammar' subdirectories of the WSF installation 'bin' directory. Further information can be found in the :doc:`developer/wsf_grammar_guide`.
