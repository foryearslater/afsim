The central display of Wizard can display more than just a map view and text-editors.
Dock widgets can be moved into the middle display and many may be shown at a time.
To move displays to the center drag them over the edges of the central display.  Once docked, right clicking will present the following options:

* Move To New Window : This will move a dock widget out of the central display and make it a window.  This menu option will only appear if the dock widget is in the central display.
* Hide : Hides a dock widget.  To unhide a dock widget, use the View toolbar to enable the dock widget.  This option will only appear if the dock widget is in the central display.
* Close : Closes the dock widget.
* FullScreen (F11) : Toggles whether the dock widget should be displayed as fullscreen or not.

These windows may be placed in the central display:
