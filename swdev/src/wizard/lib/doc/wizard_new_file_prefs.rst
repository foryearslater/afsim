New File Preferences - Wizard
-----------------------------

.. image:: images/wizard_preferences_new_file.png

The **New File** preferences can be used to set custom file headers for files generated by AFSIM.

The user may create as many profiles as desired and switch between them using the drop-down menu on the top of the window.

The *Add header* button (+) creates a new blank item.
The *Remove header* button (-) removes the currently selected item.

Checking *Insert header as a comment* will cause a # to be inserted at the beginning of every line.
Checking *Replace text macros* will cause certain words looking like %THIS% to be replaced by other text when the file is created.

The list of available macros can be found by clicking the *Macro help* button. The available macros can also be found here.

* One header: the file is generated with that header.
* Multiple headers: the user is prompted for which header to use.
