* Implemented and improved validation for inputs to :doc:`Platform Details<../wkf_plugin/wiz_platform_details>` attribute fields. (:issue:`AFSIM-400`)
* Added support for descriptions on all nodes rather than just trees for :doc:`Advanced Behavior Trees<../advanced_behavior_tree>`.  The :command:`advanced_behavior_tree.name` and :command:`advanced_behavior_tree.desc` commands have been swapped to use <quotable-string> grammar tokens for more robust string handling. (:issue:`AFSIM-1186`)
* Added visualization of spherical zones to the :doc:`Zone Editor<../wkf_plugin/wiz_zone_editor>`. (:issue:`AFSIM-597`)
* Added support for :command:`platform` and :command:`mover` altitude reference to Wizard. (:issue:`AFSIM-1030`)
* Added visualization of global zones created using the :command:`zone.references` command. (:issue:`AFSIM-1113`)
* Added various features to help debug line readability, and changed button layout for the :doc:`Script Debugger<../wkf_plugin/wiz_script_debugger>`. (:issue:`AFSIM-1465`)
* Added support for displaying aux data for simulation objects in the :ref:`Watch Control<docs/wkf_plugin/wiz_script_debugger:Watch Variables>`. (:issue:`AFSIM-1521`)
* Added comment folding for block comments and consecutive line comments that do not overlap with exiting folds. (:issue:`AFSIM-1525`)
* :doc:`Text Editor <../wizard_text_editor>` margin icons now resize with font. (:issue:`AFSIM-1852`)
* Indentation and deindentation in :doc:`Wizard Text Editor<../wizard_text_editor>` now jumps to nearest indent multiple (:issue:`AFSIM-1853`)
