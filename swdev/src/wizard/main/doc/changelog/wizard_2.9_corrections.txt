* Fixed the issue where moving a point-of-interest via Ctrl+Left-click drag, via the :doc:`Rotate <../wkf_plugin/wiz_rotate>` dialog, or via the :doc:`Translate <../wkf_plugin/wiz_translate>` dialog would crash Wizard if the point-of-interest did not have a position defined. (:issue:`AFSIM-1406`)
* Auto-complete popup no longer appears when requested on :ref:`basic script types<docs/script:Basic Types>`. (:issue:`AFSIM-185`)
* Fixed case where attempting to view reference info through the :doc:`Text Editor<../wizard_text_editor>`'s context menu would fail in some cases. (:issue:`AFSIM-389`)
* Fixed bug where changing certain preferred units in :doc:`Preferences<../wizard_preferences>` would slightly alter :doc:`Text Editor<../wizard_text_editor>` values. (:issue:`AFSIM-400`)
* User actions applied to points-of-interest and bullseyes (including those from :doc:`Rotate Dialog<../wkf_plugin/wiz_translate>` or :doc:`Translate Dialog<../wkf_plugin/wiz_translate>`) can now be undone. (:issue:`AFSIM-598`)
* Fixed an issue where externally editing a scenario file would cause an asterisk to appear by the file name when there are no unsaved changes. (:issue:`AFSIM-615`)
* Corrected an issue where the asterisk would not appear after the file name in the Text Editor if there was only one file open. (:issue:`AFSIM-809`)
* Corrected an issue where docking the :doc:`Map Display <../wkf_plugin/wiz_map_display>` with a :doc:`Text Editor <../wizard_text_editor>` tab would make the Map Display tab unclosable. (:issue:`AFSIM-809`)
* Corrected grammar rule for the :command:`WSF_TSPI_MOVER.filename` used by the :model:`WSF_TSPI_MOVER` to allow the parser to identify scenario dependencies. (:issue:`AFSIM-974`)
* Fixed an issue where an erroneous heading command would be inserted in the :doc:`Text Editor<../wizard_text_editor>` if a platform was dragged to a new location on the :doc:`Map Display<../wkf_plugin/wiz_map_display>`. (:issue:`AFSIM-980`)
* Fixed issue where scenarios would partially run before :doc:`Script Debugger<../wkf_plugin/wiz_script_debugger>` breakpoints would break. (:issue:`AFSIM-1072`)
* Fixed issues where Wizard would not append attributes to platforms and zones correctly. (:issue:`AFSIM-1036` :issue:`AFSIM-1045`)
* Fixed the issue where moving a platform via Ctrl+Left-click drag, via the :doc:`Rotate <../wkf_plugin/wiz_rotate>` dialog, or via the :doc:`Translate <../wkf_plugin/wiz_translate>` dialog may corrupt input in the Text Editor. (:issue:`AFSIM-1050`)
* Corrected an issue where polygonal zones defined using MGRS coordinates or polar coordinates were incorrectly displayed (:issue:`AFSIM-1109`)
* Corrected some issues causing points in polygonal :doc:`zones<../zone>` to display incorrectly (:issue:`AFSIM-1110`)
* Clicking "Clear Recents" button on the :doc:`Start-up Dialog <../wizard_start_page>` will clear the :doc:`File\>Open Recent <../wizard_file_menu>` menu. (:issue:`AFSIM-1116`)
* Corrected an issue where circular and elliptical :doc:`zones<../zone>` had unexpected behavior while being dragged (:issue:`AFSIM-1154`)
* Global :command:`route`\s containing :command:`route.offset` waypoints now render correctly. (:issue:`AFSIM-1176`)
* Fixed issue where zones defined on a platform would not be updated if the platform's :command:`platform.heading` was changed. (:issue:`AFSIM-1200`)
* Fixed issue where :command:`zone` visualization would sometimes not match the simulation when using the :command:`zone.reference_platform` command. (:issue:`AFSIM-1201`)
* Fixed issue where Wizard would not display members of a :command:`zone_set` if they were included with :command:`zone_set.use_zone` or :command:`zone_set.use_exclude_zone`. (:issue:`AFSIM-1202`)
* Corrected an issue where using both embedded inclusion zones and embedded exclusion zones in a :doc:`zone set<../zone_set>` would cause a crash. (:issue:`AFSIM-1203`)
* Fixed issue where Wizard would not display zones if they were in a :command:`zone.references` chain of length 2 or greater. (:issue:`AFSIM-1249`)
* Corrected an issue where right-clicking a :doc:`../zone` in the :doc:`Zone Editor<../wkf_plugin/wiz_zone_editor>` and clicking "Go to Definition" crashed Wizard, for zones defined on platforms using :command:`platform.use_zone`. (:issue:`AFSIM-1316`)
* Corrected an issue where :command:`platform`-defined :command:`zones<zone>`, when defined using :command:`platform.use_zone`, could sometimes inherit their parent platform's :command:`platform.heading` when they weren't supposed to. (:issue:`AFSIM-1349`)
* Improved scenario loading performance. (:issue:`AFSIM-1385`)
* Fixed a Wizard crash that happens when the scenario input has a chain of :command:`include` commands that is too long. (:issue:`AFSIM-1654`)
* The "Select All" action (default Ctrl-A) now works in both editor and console windows (:issue:`AFSIM-857`)
* Improved handling of code folding in :doc:`text editor<../wizard_text_editor>`. (:issue:`AFSIM-1917`)
* Fixed a crash where opening a project during a :doc:`Wizard Debugger<../wkf_plugin/wiz_script_debugger>` run would crash :doc:`Wizard<../wizard>`. (:issue:`AFSIM-1848`)
* Added a user prompt to stop the current run or all runs when the Stop Debugging button is pressed while using the :doc:`Wizard Debugger<../wkf_plugin/wiz_script_debugger>` on a multi-run simulation. (:issue:`AFSIM-1779`)
* Fixed a bug where recursive data was presented for script watches (:issue:`AFSIM-1780`)
* Allow the use of :command:`_.script_commands.script_variables` for :command:`mover.update_interval` in the grammar. (:issue:`AFSIM-2180`)
* Added base mover commands to the :model:`WSF_TBM_MOVER` grammar.
