* **(2.7.3)** Fixed an issue where externally editing a scenario file would cause an asterisk to appear by the file name when there are no unsaved changes. *(AFSIM-615)*
* **(2.7.3)** Corrected grammar rule for the :command:`WSF_TSPI_MOVER.filename` used by the :model:`WSF_TSPI_MOVER` to allow the parser to identify scenario dependencies. *(AFSIM-974)*
* **(2.7.3)** Corrected an issue where circular and elliptical :doc:`zones<../zone>` had unexpected behavior while being dragged *(AFSIM-1154)*
* **(2.7.3)** Corrected an issue where using both embedded inclusion zones and embedded exclusion zones in a :doc:`zone set<../zone_set>` would cause a crash. *(AFSIM-1203)*
* **(2.7.2)** Fixed grammar for :command:`conditional_section.conditionals.wsf_version` to support X.X and X.X.X version numbers. *(AFSIM-963)*
* **(2.7.2)** Fixed crash when getting the large directory warning message while the loaded scenario has global zones. *(AFSIM-972)*
* **(2.7.2)** Fixed a crash that occurs when the name of a platform_type is deleted in the text editor. *(AFSIM-991)*
* **(2.7.1)** Added missing grammar for :command:`false_target_screener.j_to_s_delta_threshold` and updated the documentation. *(AFSIM-205)*
* **(2.7.1)** Fixed syntax highlighting issues with :doc:`pre-processor<../wsf_user_input_format>` variables. When a ``$define`` variable was referenced using the ``$<var>$`` syntax with no default value in a script, the lines following the referenced variable would no longer have the correct syntax highlighting. *(AFSIM-621)*
* Added missing grammar for :model:`WSF_CARLTON_LETHALITY` and :model:`WSF_EXOATMOSPHERIC_LETHALITY`. *(AFSIM-140)*
* Wizard will display an error message when :doc:`Pattern Visualization<../wkf_plugin/wiz_pattern_visualization>` fails to load the scenario file instead of crashing. *(AFSIM-149)*
* Fixed multiple crashes involving Auto Complete within the :doc:`Text Editor<../wizard_text_editor>` *(AFSIM-155)*
* Fixed an issue with the Auto Complete menu remaining after switching tabs in the :doc:`Text Editor<../wizard_text_editor>`. *(AFSIM-162)*
* Fixed a bug where the altitude in the zone editor was using the user's preferred length unit instead of the altitude unit. *(AFSIM-189)*
* Added missing grammar for a :command:`callback` defined at the global scope. *(AFSIM-191)*
* Corrected grammar for a :command:`callback` defined at the platform scope to indicate a syntax error if the processor named in the :command:`callback.execute` command cannot be found. *(AFSIM-192)*
* Fixed a bug where :command:`route` using offsets would not display correctly. *(AFSIM-196)*
* Fixed syntax highlighting issues when using the :command:`platform.delete` command on zones. *(AFSIM-199)*
* Fixed syntax highlighting issues with :command:`script_struct`. *(Issue #300)*
* Corrected the grammar for :command:`visual_part` so that it is recognized by Wizard and syntax-highlighted correctly. *(Issue #1433)*
* Fixed a crash that occurred when running :doc:`Astrolabe<../wkf_plugin/wiz_astrolabe>`'s Verify command on a platform with an external include in its body. *(Issue #1672)*
* Many unit input widgets are now validated more thoroughly. *(Issue #1754)*
* Documentation links are now at the beginning of the :doc:`Command Documentation<../wizard_command_documentation>` dialog. *(Issue #2028)*
* Corrected the grammar so that the :command:`sensor_mode.send_track_drop_on_turn_off` and :command:`filter` will not be valid on non-tracking sensors. *(Issue #2032)*
* Fixed an issue with routes defined within WSF_ROTORCRAFT_MOVER not being displayed on the map. *(Issue #2093)*
* Fixed issue where the Ok and Cancel Buttons on the Configure Startup Files Dialog were not responding to user interactions. *(Issue #2168)*
* Fixed an issue where Wizard was throwing an exception and closing when parsing a script block with more than 65,536 characters. Wizard will no longer exit but will still have problems with syntax highlighting of large script blocks. *(Issue #2176)*
* Fixed issue with console warning message losing it's formatting when converted to an HTML link. *(Issue #2197)*
* Fixed an issue where moving a platform on the map could change the sign of the heading value and could put multiple "heading" commands inside or outside of the platform definition  *(Issue #2222)*
* Fixed a crash involving routes and zones when the map display plugin is not loaded *(Issue #2250)*
* Fixed a bug where renaming :doc:`aux_data<../aux_data>` variables would add them as platforms at the origin. *(Issue #2304)*
* Fixed a crash that occurs after loading a :doc:`configuration<../wizard_user_configurations>` file. *(Issue #2393)*
* Fixed a crash that occurs after closing wizard without saving, if the main window is configured a certain way. *(Issue #2400)*
* Fixed a bug where :doc:`Text Editor<../wizard_text_editor>` files would close upon opening the Rename File dialog. *(Issue #2420)*
* Fixed a bug where :doc:`zones<../zone>` may be duplicated in the :doc:`Zone Browser<../wkf_plugin/wiz_zone_editor>` when parsing incomplete block commands, often leading to a crash. *(Issue #2288)*
* Fixed a bug which could cause a crash on exit while debugging script. *(Issue #2428)*
