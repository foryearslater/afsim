New Features and Bug Fixes
==========================

* Scenario browser is organized by directory.
* Multiple "main" files can be loaded simultaneously - they show up under the "Main Files" directory in the scenario browser.
* Added the ability specify a "root" directory (Projects->Settings). By default this is the directory that the main file sits in.
