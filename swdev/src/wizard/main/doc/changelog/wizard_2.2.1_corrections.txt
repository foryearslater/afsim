* **(Issue #366)** Modified :ref:`correlation_methods.nearest_neighbor` correlation to provide a more accurate correlation estimates for tracks with oblate-shaped covariance matrices.
* **(Issue #381)** Fixed a tracking-related issue where track history (enabled using the :command:`track_manager.retain_track_history` command) was not being saved.
* **(Issue #493)** Fixed an issue where the ***UtCalendar::GetTimeSince*** method was found to sometimes return an incorrect value when the epoch was within about a microsecond of a day boundary.
* **(Issue #534)** Fixed an issue where **UtSun::GetSunLocationWCS** was returning a unit vector pointing towards the Sun rather than the actual location vector.
* **(ELSZ #9) (Issue #585)** Fixed an issue where a platform's orientation angles were not be normalized when being set.
* **(ELSZ #14)** Fixed a documentation issue for :command:`track_manager.aux_data_fusion_rules` where it was missed in a previous update when the command name was changed from 'aux_data_fusion'. 
* **(MANTIS #193)** Fixed issue with :method:`WsfSensor.TurnOn` and :method:`WsfSensor.TurnOff` causing the sensor to turn on or off multiple times when already in the current on/off state.
* **(MANTIS #215)** Fixed a segmentation fault issue with the :command:`_.script_commands.script` and :command:`_.script_commands.script_variables` not providing proper checking of the closing block statements: end_script and end_script_variables, repectively.
* **(MANTIS #221) (Issue #552)** Fixed an issue where the :command:`behavior_tree.run_selection` and :command:`behavior_tree.make_selection` commands in a Behavior Tree were not functional.
* **(MANTIS #222) (Issue #567)** Modified :command:`behavior` nodes to report WSF_BEHAVIOR for their base type and the user-specified <type-name> for both their name and type.
* **(MANTIS #260) (Issue #595)** Fixed issue with zone checks where a platform was incorrectly being reported within a zone that was on the opposite side of the globe.
* **(MANTIS #277) (Issue #525)** In script, when trying to access an AuxDataObject that is not an Object but a basic type (bool, int, double, string), mission was exiting after throwing an exception. The scripting language was modified to handle this special case.
* **(MANTIS #281)** Fixed an issue where a DIS Platform Articulation fails to update in certain cases.
* **(MANTIS #301)** Fixed an issue with :command:`WSF_TRACK_PROCESSOR.report_method` not parsing the *batch* and *cyclic* inputs.
* **(MANTIS #302) (Issue #517)** Fixed an issue where the application would crash when defining a signature or masking pattern that failed to initialize properly.
* **(MANTIS #303)** Fixed issue with missing grammar for :command:`radar_signature.plt_file`.
* **(MANTIS #306) (Issue #514)** Fixed an issue that would cause the mission application to crash when constructing a WsfMessage object outside of a platform script context.
* **(MANTIS #308) (Issue #553)** Fixed an issue where the simulation would crash when trying to access a global zone using a platform-local reference to that global zone.
* **(MANTIS #313) (Issue #482)** Fixed an issue where tracks with location were being fused incorrectly with angle-only tracks (bearing, bearing-elevation), using :ref:`fusion_methods.replacement` and :ref:`fusion_methods.weighted_average` fusion.
* **(MANTIS #317)** Fixed an issue with the *AddSensor* and *RemoveSensor* for sensor processors type processors.
* **(MANTIS #322) (Issue #588)** Fixed an issue with the on_task_complete and the on_task_complete_sent script blocks not getting triggered on a :model:`WSF_TASK_PROCESSOR`.
* **(MANTIS #326)** Fixed issue with missing grammar for :command:`_.External_Link_Commands.external_link` options.
