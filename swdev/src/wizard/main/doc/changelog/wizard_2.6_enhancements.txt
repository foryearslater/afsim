* Added a :doc:`Comms Visualization Tool <../wkf_plugin/wiz_comm_vis>` tool which provides a GUI based method for users to visualize and interact with communications/network configurations.  This tool is being provided in the release as an initial read-only version of the tool with more features yet to come. *(Issue #1312)*
* Waypoints are automatically selected when created via the :doc:`map display<../wkf_plugin/wiz_map_display>` or :doc:`Route Browser<../wkf_plugin/wiz_route_browser>`. *(Issue #1349)*
* Reintroduced the :doc:`Rotate <../wkf_plugin/wiz_rotate>` and :doc:`Translate <../wkf_plugin/wiz_translate>` widgets. *(Issue #1509)*
* Modified wizard::Platform to update heading in the input after rotating a scenario or selection. *(Issue #1509)*
* Sky conditions in the :doc:`map<../wkf_plugin/wiz_map_display>` will show properly for scenario :command:`start_date`. *(Issue #1531)*
* Added a handler for altitudes specified in AGL; this affects where platforms are rendered on the :doc:`Map Display<../wkf_plugin/wiz_map_display>` as well as the information displayed in :doc:`Hover Tooltips<../wkf_plugin/wiz_map_hover_info>` and :doc:`Platform Details<../wkf_plugin/wiz_platform_details>`. *(Issue #1580)*
* For consistency, in the map display context menu, moved the :doc:`Platform<../wizard_create_platform>` and :doc:`Zone<../wkf_plugin/wiz_zone_editor>` creation dialogs to the "Add at Location" submenu. *(Issue #1647)*
* Items in :doc:`Cursor Info<../wkf_plugin/wiz_cursor_info>` can now be dragged onto the :doc:`map<../wkf_plugin/wiz_map_display>` to create a data overlay. *(Issue #1658)*
* Added the :doc:`ACO Importer<../wkf_plugin/wiz_aco_importer>` plugin which allows the user to import platforms and zones that are specified in USMTF Air Control Orders. *(Issue #1696)* *(Issue #1697)*
* Zone modification via the text editor will now update the zone in the map window. *(Issue #1737)*
* Various improvements to the :doc:`Constellation Maker <../wkf_plugin/wiz_constellation_maker>`: input lines allow for unit specification, orbit size can be specified in four equivalent ways, UI will prevent creating a constellation for a platform type without a space mover, and the UI provides a warning when the constellation parameters would lead to a conjunction. *(Issue #1761)*
* Added the :doc:`Color Util<../wkf_plugin/wiz_color_utils>` plugin which allows the user to view colors generated by :class:`Color` static methods and the :command:`platform.side` command. *(Issue #1804)*
* Added the option to customize the :doc:`header <../wizard_new_file_prefs>` when Wizard generates a new file. *(Issue #1830)*
* :doc:`Range rings<../wkf_plugin/wiz_map_annotation>` can now be toggled between aligning with the platform or true north. *(Issue #1860)*
* Added the :doc:`Team Visibility<../wkf_plugin/wiz_visibility>` dialog to allow user to quickly control the visibility of teams in a scenario. *(Issue #1905)*
* Added an option to select a platform from the :doc:`editor<../wizard_text_editor>` context menu. *(Issue #1966)*
