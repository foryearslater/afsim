* Relocated changelogs into a subfolder in the docs directories to enable appending sections of the changelog by projects. This enhancement allows for changelogs to be built by the projects that are included, alleviating the issue with having a single source.
* Code signature of WsfApplicationExtension::ProcessCommandLine changed to pass the Options structure from WsfStandardApplication to the extension when processing command line arguments.
* **(Issue #457)** UtMath has been converted to constexpr constants and into a namespace
* **(Issue #479)** Refactored of sensor detector and error models to classes and sensor support for compositional architecture of these sub-models.
* **(MANTIS #305)** Fixed a possible overflow condition with :command:`random_seed_time` due to casting from double to integer. Now using a long int type to cast to for initial random seed value.
* Updated :doc:`../developer/build_instructions` documentation to add in regression testing instructions.
