* The text editor may become unresponsive while the Map Display is hidden.  Showing the Map Display again will cause the text editor to function normally.  This problem seems to be hardware dependent as it does not occur on many computers.
* There is no way to select zones on the map.
* There is no way to undo modifications to annotations on the map after scenario transformation.
* There may be inconsistent behavior when calling undo on global zones and global routes.
* Zones inside platform definitions may be drawn at the origin (0n, 0w) or not drawn at all.
