* **(2.8.1)** Fixed case where attempting to view reference info through the :doc:`Text Editor<../wizard_text_editor>`'s context menu would fail in some cases. (:issue:`AFSIM-389`)
* **(2.8.1)** Fixed an issue where externally editing a scenario file would cause an asterisk to appear by the file name when there are no unsaved changes. (:issue:`AFSIM-615`)
* **(2.8.1)** Corrected grammar rule for the :command:`WSF_TSPI_MOVER.filename` used by the :model:`WSF_TSPI_MOVER` to allow the parser to identify scenario dependencies. (:issue:`AFSIM-974`)
* **(2.8.1)** Fixed issue where scenarios would partially run before :doc:`Script Debugger<../wkf_plugin/wiz_script_debugger>` breakpoints would break. (:issue:`AFSIM-1072`)
* **(2.8.1)** Corrected an issue where circular and elliptical :doc:`zones<../zone>` had unexpected behavior while being dragged (:issue:`AFSIM-1154`)
* **(2.8.1)** Corrected an issue where the asterisk would not appear after the file name in the Text Editor if there was only one file open. (:issue:`AFSIM-809`)
* **(2.8.1)** Corrected an issue where docking the :doc:`Map Display <../wkf_plugin/wiz_map_display>` with a :doc:`Text Editor <../wizard_text_editor>` tab would make the Map Display tab unclosable. (:issue:`AFSIM-809`)
* **(2.8.1)** Clicking "Clear Recents" button on the :doc:`Start-up Dialog <../wizard_start_page>` will clear the :doc:`File\>Open Recent <../wizard_file_menu>` menu. (:issue:`AFSIM-1116`)
* **(2.8.1)**  Corrected an issue where using both embedded inclusion zones and embedded exclusion zones in a :doc:`zone set<../zone_set>` would cause a crash. (:issue:`AFSIM-1203`)
* Fixed issues with the :doc:`Text Editor<../wizard_text_editor>`'s Auto Complete, where choosing a suggestion would leave part of the original string after the replacement. (:issue:`AFSIM-129`)
* Fixed issue where executing some scenarios in the :doc:`Script Debugger<../wkf_plugin/wiz_script_debugger>` would produce different output than when executing without the Script Debugger. (:issue:`AFSIM-138`)
* When running Wizard in Windows, a project's directory is unlocked when the project is closed instead of when Wizard exits. (:issue:`AFSIM-160`)
* Added missing grammar for :command:`false_target_screener.j_to_s_delta_threshold` and updated the documentation. (:issue:`AFSIM-205`)
* Wizard will no longer center on the scenario when a scenario is loaded if the "Center on Start" option is not enabled in :doc:`Wizard Preferences<../wizard_preferences>`. (:issue:`AFSIM-357`)
* Wizard will display platform and waypoint locations correctly when specified in MGRS. (:issue:`AFSIM-363`)
* Fixed issue where the :doc:`Text Editor<../wizard_text_editor>`'s style preferences would not update until text was added to the editor. (:issue:`AFSIM-392`)
* Fixed syntax highlighting issues with :doc:`pre-processor<../wsf_user_input_format>` variables. When a ``$define`` variable was referenced using the ``$<var>$`` syntax with no default value in a script, the lines following the referenced variable would no longer have the correct syntax highlighting. (:issue:`AFSIM-621`)
* Corrected the grammar for :model:`WSF_TRACK_STATE_CONTROLLER` so that the common script interface methods would be recognized (i.e. script_variables, on_initialize, etc.). (:issue:`AFSIM-753`)
* Now, when a user opens a project, the :doc:`File\>Open Recent <../wizard_file_menu>` menu will add the project to the top of the list. (:issue:`AFSIM-773`)
* Fixed a crash happening under multiple circumstances with a bad .afproj file. (:issue:`AFSIM-853`)
* Fixed grammar for :command:`conditional_section.conditionals.wsf_version` to support X.X and X.X.X version numbers. (:issue:`AFSIM-963`)
* Fixed crash when getting the large directory warning message while the loaded scenario has global zones. (:issue:`AFSIM-972`)
* Fixed a crash that occurs when the name of a platform_type is deleted in the text editor. (:issue:`AFSIM-991`)
