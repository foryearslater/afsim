* **(2.6.3)** Fixed grammar for :command:`conditional_section.conditionals.wsf_version` to support X.X and X.X.X version numbers. *(AFSIM-963)*
* **(2.6.3)** Fixed crash when getting the large directory warning message while the loaded scenario has global zones. *(AFSIM-972)*
* **(2.6.3)** Fixed a crash that occurs when the name of a platform_type is deleted in the text editor. *(AFSIM-991)*
* **(2.6.2)** Added missing grammar for :command:`false_target_screener.j_to_s_delta_threshold` and updated the documentation. *(AFSIM-205)*
* **(2.6.2)** Wizard will display an error message when :doc:`Pattern Visualization<../wkf_plugin/wiz_pattern_visualization>` fails to load the scenario file instead of crashing. *(AFSIM-149)*
* **(2.6.2)** Fixed an issue with the Auto Complete menu remaining after switching tabs in the :doc:`Text Editor<../wizard_text_editor>`. *(AFSIM-162)*
* **(2.6.2)** Added missing grammar for a :command:`callback` defined at the global scope. *(AFSIM-191)*
* **(2.6.2)** Corrected grammar for a :command:`callback` defined at the platform scope to indicate a syntax error if the processor named in the :command:`callback.execute` command cannot be found. *(AFSIM-192)*
* **(2.6.2)** Fixed a bug where :command:`route` using offsets would not display correctly. *(AFSIM-196)*
* **(2.6.2)** Fixed syntax highlighting issues with :command:`script_struct`. *(Issue #300)*
* **(2.6.2)** Corrected the grammar for :command:`visual_part` so that it is recognized by Wizard and syntax-highlighted correctly. *(Issue #1433)*
* **(2.6.2)** Corrected the grammar so that the :command:`sensor_mode.send_track_drop_on_turn_off` and :command:`filter` will not be valid on non-tracking sensors. *(Issue #2032)*
* **(2.6.2)** Fixed an issue where Wizard was throwing an exception and closing when parsing a script block with more than 65,536 characters. Wizard will no longer exit but will still have problems with syntax highlighting of large script blocks. *(Issue #2176)*
* **(2.6.2)** Fixed a crash that occurs after closing wizard without saving, if the main window is configured a certain way. *(Issue #2400)*
* **(2.6.2)** Fixed a bug where :doc:`Text Editor<../wizard_text_editor>` files would close upon opening the Rename File dialog. *(Issue #2420)*
* **(2.6.2)** Fixed a bug which could cause a crash on exit while debugging script. *(Issue #2428)*
* **(2.6.1)** Fixed a crash that occurred when running :doc:`Astrolabe<../wkf_plugin/wiz_astrolabe>`'s Verify command on a platform with an external include in its body. *(Issue #1672)*
* **(2.6.1)** Fixed an issue where moving a platform on the map could change the sign of the heading value and could put multiple "heading" commands inside or outside of the platform definition *(Issue #2222)*
* **(2.6.1)** Fixed a crash involving routes and zones when the map display plugin is not loaded *(Issue #2250)*
* **(2.6.1)** Fixed a bug where renaming :doc:`aux_data<../aux_data>` variables would add them as platforms at the origin. *(Issue #2304)*
* **(2.6.1)** Fixed a crash that occurs after loading a :doc:`configuration<../wizard_user_configurations>` file. *(Issue #2393)*
* **(2.6.1)** Fixed multiple crashes involving Auto Complete within the :doc:`Text Editor<../wizard_text_editor>` *(AFSIM-155)*
* Fixed a crash that occurred when an :command:`include` command in a file created a circular dependency. *(Issue #1601)*
* Zones are now created at scenario startup  *(Issue #1737)*
* Fixed a crash that occurred when loading an older version of an application from the simulation manager. *(Issue #1793)*
* Fixed a crash that happens when previewing a function using autocomplete. *(Issue #1872)*
* Selecting "View Type Info..." from the :doc:`Platform Browser <../wkf_plugin/wiz_platform_browser>` or :doc:`Type Browser <../wkf_plugin/wiz_type_browser>` context menus will show the correct line numbers and not crash when following a link to the first line of a file. *(Issue #1876)*
* Fixed a bug where the "Platform Options" widget, when showing the global platform options, would show different entries for "Side" for anything typed into the text editor.  The "Platform Options" widget now only shows the sides that are currently used in the scenario.  *(Issue #1884)*
* Fixed an issue where adding and moving :doc:`routes<../wkf_plugin/wiz_route>` in the :doc:`map display<../wkf_plugin/wiz_map_display>` selected the incorrect waypoints. *(Issue #1927)*
* Corrected to only auto-select a platform when it is created from a graphical user action. *(Issue #1966)*
* Fixed a bug that would place platforms incorrectly when dragging a :doc:`platform type<../wkf_plugin/wiz_type_browser>` onto the |MAP_DISPLAY_LINK|. *(Issue #1966)*
* Fixed a bug where the Simulation Manager would say Mission when the .afproj said "No application" for the executable, which crash Wizard if the user attempted to change Preferences. *(Issue #2132)*
* Fixed a bug where changing certain details within platforms would make their components selectable. *(Issue #2299)*
