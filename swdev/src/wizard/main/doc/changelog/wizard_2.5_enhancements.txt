* Added an :doc:`option<../wkf_plugin/wiz_map_display>` to display the altitude of a scenario's loaded DTED under the mouse cursor. *(Issue #1111)*
* The :doc:`Map Overlay Banner  <../wkf_pref_general>` now displays the scenario's classification level, caveats, and trigraphs. The text is controlled via the :command:`classification` command within the scenario. *(ELSZ #98)*
* Added the :doc:`Zone Editor<../wkf_plugin/wiz_zone_editor>` dialog, which allows the user to visualize :doc:`zones <../zone>` and :doc:`zone sets <../zone_set>` as they are created and edited.
* Added support for global routes in the :doc:`Route Browser<../wkf_plugin/wiz_route_browser>` and on the :doc:`Map Window <../wizard_main_window>` *(Issue #1284)*

* Added a :doc:`Satellite Inserter <../wkf_plugin/wiz_satellite_inserter>` tool to add existing satellite definitions into scenarios, update two-line elements, and update the start time/date/epoch based on existing satellite epochs. Also added convert_platforms_to_json and make_satcat_database python scripts that will create JSON databases from AFSIM platform definitions and SATCAT data. *(Issue #1231)*
* Redesigned the :doc:`Demo Browser<../wkf_plugin/wiz_demo_browser>` to make it easier to navigate. *(ELSZ #162)*
