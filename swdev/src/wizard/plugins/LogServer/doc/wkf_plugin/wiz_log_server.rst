Interactive Output - Wizard
===========================

Overview
--------
The Log Server plugin allows Wizard to act as a server to display log messages generated by mission instances in the Interactive Output pane. 
Mission instances may be executed from Wizard or directly from the command line.

Quick Start
-----------
The log server is configured to display all log messages in Wizard's Interactive Output view. With the plugin enabled, running a scenario from a Wizard or command line created mission instance will result in log messages accumulating in Wizard's Interactive Output.

By default, the Log Server binds itself to the following socket::

    0.0.0.0:18888

This means that any IP registered to the user's machine may be used for the log server client.


Configuration
-------------
The user may configure the log server with a different port if desired or if necessary to avoid a collision.

In Wizard, log server configuration options are available from Options > Preferences > Log Server.

The following options are available:

* Port: The port on which the log server will listen. Acceptable range is 1-65535.

If running mission separately from wizard, it must be configured from the :ref:`command line<docs/mission:Command Line>` by providing options to mission.
