SPLAT - Wizard
--------------

**SPLAT** (Sensor Plot Analysis Tool) has been integrated with Wizard so that sensors defined in a scenario can be more easily analyzed.

This tool aids the user in creating an input block definition recognized by :command:`sensor_plot<sensor_plot>`. The sensor_plot application will then produce the plots specified in the SPLAT dialog.

The **SPLAT** dialog can be opened by right-clicking on a sensor in the :doc:`Type Browser <wiz_type_browser>` and selecting the "Analyze" Option.
