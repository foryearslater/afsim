* Colored text in the :doc:`Console Output<../wkf_plugin/wiz_output>` display is now customizable. (:issue:`AFSIM-1155`)
* Added Line Cap to the :doc:`Console Output Preferences<../wkf_plugin/wiz_output>`.
* The :doc:`Script Debugger<../wkf_plugin/wiz_script_debugger>` now displays breakpoints in a table and shows the hit count for each breakpoint. (:issue:`AFSIM-1466`)
* The :doc:`Script Debugger<../wkf_plugin/wiz_script_debugger>` now sorts breakpoints by file name and line number rather than by order created. (:issue:`AFSIM-1469`)
* Right-clicking a breakpoint in the :doc:`Script Debugger<../wkf_plugin/wiz_script_debugger>` now displays a context menu with options for deleting the breakpoint, enabling/disabling the breakpoint, and editing the breakpoint's condition. (:issue:`AFSIM-1471`)
* The :ref:`Watch Control<docs/wkf_plugin/wiz_script_debugger:Watch Variables>` and :ref:`Callstack<docs/wkf_plugin/wiz_script_debugger:Call Stack>` widgets no longer close themselves after completing a simulation in debug mode. (:issue:`AFSIM-1488`)
* Breakpoints placed on an invalid line will be moved to the next valid line within the same file (when able) on debugger run. (:issue:`AFSIM-1480`)
* The :ref:`Watch Control<docs/wkf_plugin/wiz_script_debugger:Watch Variables>` now preserves watches added by the user across multiple simulation runs. (:issue:`AFSIM-1519`)
* Reorganized :ref:`Breakpoints<docs/wkf_plugin/wiz_script_debugger:Breakpoints>`, :ref:`Callstack<docs/wkf_plugin/wiz_script_debugger:Call Stack>`, and :ref:`Watch Control<docs/wkf_plugin/wiz_script_debugger:Watch Variables>` into "Script Tool" submenu under View. (:issue:`AFSIM-1536`)
* Modifying any file during a debug run will now prompt the user to set all breakpoints (if any) in the file to inactive or stop the debug run. Any future breakpoints added to the file will be inactive and locked until the run is over. (:issue:`AFSIM-1596`)
* Added buttons to allow user to delete all/selected watches for script variables. (:issue:`AFSIM-1782`)
* Re-ordered buttons in :doc:`Wizard Sim Execution<../wkf_plugin/wiz_simulation_manager>`. (:issue:`AFSIM-1784`)
* Modified breakpoint handling to disallow users from stepping into modified files. (:issue:`AFSIM-1846`)
* Added "Profiling Output Path" to the Simulation Execution preferences page to support new Profiling plugin from Wizard. (:issue:`AFSIM-1866`)
* Added "Extra arguments" to the Simulation Execution preferences page to support application-specific arbitrary arguments from Wizard. (:issue:`AFSIM-1866`)
* Added restart button to :doc:`Wizard Sim Execution<../wkf_plugin/wiz_simulation_manager>`. (:issue:`AFSIM-2243`)
