Output - Wizard
===============

The **Output** window is accessible from the View menu. It appears as a tab in the :ref:`Output Panel <Wizard_Main_Window.OutputPanel>`

The output from running the scenario is displayed in this window. If an error is found in the input file, a link to the error location will appear. Clicking the link will open the file and jump to the error location. While the scenario is running, the **Kill** button may be used to abort execution.

The number of lines of output in the window is limited. For scenarios with a lot of output, there is an ability to log the output to a file. You may specify a log file by clicking the folder icon next to the "Log file" label.
