   There is a big discrepancy between csv_event_output and event_output in regard to their settings.
   The dialog takes this into consideration and will remove any invalid input.
   However, the dialog needs to preserve comments within the csv_event_output and event_output blocks.
   The comments are the green text in wizard, by default.
   Of course, this can change in the "Text Editor" Preferences...
