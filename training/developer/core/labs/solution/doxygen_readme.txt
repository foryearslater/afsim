This folder contains a pre-configured Doxyfile to pass to Doxygen.  There is no need to handle the WSF-level Doxygen in here.

To generate new Doxygen from these exercises, simply invoke doxygen.exe and pass it the Doxyfile in this folder:

<path_to_doxygen_install>\doxygen.exe Doxyfile

This will create a new "doc" folder with the compiled Doxygen documentation.
