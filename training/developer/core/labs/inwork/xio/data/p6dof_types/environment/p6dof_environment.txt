# This provides a definition of various environmental components used by the P6DOF model.
# It includes atmosphere, wind, terrain, and gravity.
#
# Atmosphere provides data pertaining to air density, pressure, temperature, etc.
#
# Wind provides a means for location-dependent wind, providing a means for wind to vary as
# a function of lat/lon and/or altitude.
#
# Terrain provides the altitude of terrain and/or other objects on which aircraft may land
# or with which an aircraft may collide. It also provides a surface normal and friction
# modifier. Moving objects (such as the deck of an aircraft carrier) will also provide
# their velocity.
#
# Gravity provides a means for detailed gravity models as a function of lat/lon and altitude.
