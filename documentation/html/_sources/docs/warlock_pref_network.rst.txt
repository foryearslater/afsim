Network Preferences - Warlock
=============================

.. image:: images/warlock_network_prefs.png

The Network Preferences page has the settings for a multicast network that Warlock plugins can use to share information not handled by :command:`DIS<dis_interface>` or :command:`XIO<xio_interface>`.

* Address - This is the multicast address. All connected sims should use the same address.
* Interface - This is the address of the local port. This list is set by scanning network interfaces. The '+' button adds a new interface that was not detected automatically.
* Port - This is the port used for sending and receiving data. All connected sims should use the same port.
