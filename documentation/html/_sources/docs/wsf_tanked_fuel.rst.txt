Overview
========

    **%%%IMPLEMENTATION OF WSF_TANKED_FUEL IS INCOMPLETE, AND DEPRECATED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.%%%**

    :model:`WSF_TANKED_FUEL` is a special :model:`WSF_TABULAR_RATE_FUEL` embedded within a platform that can be refueled or can refuel other platforms.  The fuel quantity is off-loaded from the instance of :model:`WSF_TANKED_FUEL` on the Supplier to the :model:`WSF_TANKED_FUEL` on the Receiver.

Commands
========

.. command:: desired_top_off_quantity  <mass-value>

   Specifies the lower value on a band of desired operating fuel quantity.  This value, along with
   maximum_refuel_quantity_ specifies the hysteresis band to stay within while operating in proximity to a refueling
   tanker, such as during a group ferry flight.  In other words, when fuel quantity transitions from above this quantity
   to below, it is desired to begin a fuel receive operation from a nearby tanker if possible.  Script operations may key
   upon this transition, in order to take a desired action.  Conversely, when the fuel quantity transitions from below
   maximum_refuel_quantity_ to above, a separate scripted action may be taken, such as to terminate the
   receive-in-process action.

   Default: 0

.. command:: maximum_receive_rate  <mass-flow-rate>

   Specifies the maximum rate at which the platform can be refueled.

   Default: 0

.. command:: maximum_refuel_quantity  <mass-value>

   Specifies the upper value on a band of desired operating fuel quantity.  See desired_top_off_quantity_ for more
   detail.

   Default: 0

.. command:: receive_method  [ hose | boom ]

   Sets the method that this tanked fuel may use to receive fuel.  At the time a fuel supply operation between two tanks
   is initiated, the Tanker must have an available fuel supply point that matches the Receiver's configuration, or the
   transfer cannot begin.  See supply_method_preference_.

   Default:  NO_METHOD - Not enabled to receive fuel.

.. command:: supply_location_preference  [ wing | center ]

   Sets the *preferred* location that this tanked fuel may use to supply fuel.  Often a tanker may have multiple stations
   to supply fuel, leading to some ambiguity about which transfer point should be used, so this setting is consulted to
   resolve the ambiguity, if necessary.  Run-time software is permitted to change this setting to reconfigure to an
   anticipated receiver arrival.

   Default:  NO_PREFERENCE - No expressed preference for refueling location.

.. command:: supply_method_preference  [ hose | boom ]

   Sets the *preferred* method that this tanked fuel may use to supply fuel.  Often a tanker may have multiple methods to
   supply fuel, leading to some ambiguity about which type of transfer should be attempted, so this setting is consulted
   to resolve the ambiguity, if necessary.  At the time a fuel supply operation between two tanks is initiated, the Tanker
   must have an available fuel supply point type that matches the Receiver's configuration, or the transfer cannot begin.
   See receive_method_.  Run-time software is permitted to change this setting to reconfigure to an anticipated
   receiver arrival.

   Default:  NO_METHOD - No expressed preference refueling method.

.. command:: supply_point  [ left | center | right ] [ boom | hose ] '<mass-flow-rate>'

   Specify the maximum flow rate for a fuel supply point station.  This value may be reduced if the receiver's maximum
   receive rate is less.  This command should be repeated for each available refueling station.
