link16_interface

Overview

This command configures the link16 interface. The absence of this command will disable the Link 16 interface.

Subcommands
===========

.. command:: tdl_header <header-type>

   * <header-type> : The TDL header type used when writing DIS Signal messages.  This can be either 6 or 100.

   **Default** 100

.. command:: swap_tdl_header_100_method <swap-type>

   We support two different ways of transmitting TDL-100.  <swap-type> can be **fields_only** or
   **fields_then_word_boundary**.

   **Default** **fields-only**

.. command:: print_script_usage

   Outputs information about the :ref:`WsfTadilJ` classes for scripting J-Messages.

.. command:: ignore_inbound_messages <boolean-value>

   Specifies whether to ignore inbound l16 DIS messages.  If this is set to *true*, WSF will not attempt to process
   j-messages received over DIS.  This does **not** affect J11 messages.

   **Default** false

.. command:: debug

Enables debug output for the Link16 interface.

.. command:: fill_with_31.7 <boolean-value>

Enables or disables filling signal PDU's with 31.7 messages.  If enabled, signal PDU's will contain enough 31.7 words to total 3, 6, or 12 words for the entire message.  This option is available for compatibility with certain simulations.

**Default** no

.. command:: include_dis_entity_id_in_j3x_tracks <boolean-value>

This is used when converting WSF tracks to J3.X surveillance track messages. When "true', an extension word will be appended which contains the DIS Entity ID of the truth object  represented by the track.

**Default** false

J11 Commands
============

.. command:: allow_any_comm

Allow any comm device to send/receive J11 messages. In other words, a :model:`WSF_JTIDS_TERMINAL` is NOT required.

.. command:: network_enabled_weapon_type <weapon-platform-type> <integer-value>

This is used to map the platform type of a weapon to an integer value used in the "Type of NEW" field in the J11.0I word. Valid range is 0 to 11. (See J11 spec definition for use of the field)

.. note::
   Create one or more of these for each platform type used as a weapon.

**Default** 0

.. command:: use_time_of_target_measurement

On receiving a J11.1-5 In-Flight Target Update (IFTU) Directive, the "TIME OF TARGET MEASUREMENT" in continuation word 3 will be used to extrapolate the IFTU data to the current simulation time of the receiving simulation. The IFTU time value is expected to be the simulation time of the sending simulation and assumes a time synchronization is occurring between the sending and receiving applications. (This does not adhere to the J11 spec. definition for use of the field)

**Default** off

.. command:: wift_interval  <time-value>

Time interval for sending the J11.0-4 Weapon In-Flight Track (WIFT) Report.

.. command:: print_messages

Print the contents of the J11 messages when sending or receiving.
