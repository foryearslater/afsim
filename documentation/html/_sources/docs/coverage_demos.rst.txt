| This directory contains demos that illustrate the :doc:`AFSIM Coverage capability<wsf_coverage_overview>`.
| The following top-level startup files demonstrate the various operations as indicated:

1st_conus_zone.txt
------------------

| Demonstrates coverage using a :model:`WSF_ZONE_BASED_GRID` of platforms within CONUS. The zones/conus.txt
| file is where the zone is defined, and the gridpoints are spaced according to what is defined in the
| grid block. The sat_con satellites are the assets providing the sensor coverage.

2nd_uav_terrain_stepped.txt
---------------------------

| Demonstrates coverage using a :model:`WSF_DISTANCE_STEPPED_GRID` of platforms, which sit on terrain in Colorado.
| The gridpoints are spaced with a given distance and locked to a defined origin. The UAV platform flies in an
| orbital route to provide coverage. The terrain/uav_coverage_terrain.txt file loads the terrain and draws it
| for visualization in Mystic.

3rd_state_zones.txt
-------------------

| Demonstrates a :model:`WSF_COMPOSITE_GRID`, which is made up of two grids, each of which is a :model:`WSF_ZONE_BASED_GRID`,
| of platforms in the states of Texas and Florida. The sat_con satellites are the assets providing sensor coverage.

4th_lat_lon_global.txt
----------------------

| Demonstrates global coverage using a :model:`WSF_LAT_LON_GRID` spanning the earth. The sat_con
| satellites are the assets providing sensor coverage.

5th_existing_platform.txt
-------------------------

| Demonstrates coverage using a :model:`WSF_EXISTING_PLATFORM_GRID`, made up of five air targets flying West
| to East over a ground station. The ground station is the coverage asset providing sensor coverage,
| with the ground station sensor tracking the air targets as they move.

6th_geo_belt.txt
----------------

| Demonstrates coverage of satellites in geosynchronous orbit using a :model:`WSF_LAT_LON_GRID`.
| The satellite coverage assets are made up of the sat_con constellation, with scripts used to point their
| respective sensors towards the GEO grid, and a ground station with a stationary sensor. The included SAT
| platform has a processor attached checking for exclusion constraints that disallow geometric access and
| line of sight to target.
