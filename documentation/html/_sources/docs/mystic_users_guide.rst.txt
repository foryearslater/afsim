Setup the simulation
====================

Mystic uses the recorded results of an AFSIM simulation :command:`event_pipe`, known as AFSIM event recordings (AER) files generated by the simulation. AER files are binary files that similar in nature to event logs.

To generate an AER file from AFSIM input, add a block like the following:

.. parsed-literal::

 event_pipe
    file myAERfile.aer
 end_event_pipe

There are additional options documented on the :command:`event_pipe` page.

Launch Mystic
=============

.. image:: ./images/mystic_project_browser.png

Double-clicking on the AER file in the Wizard project browser will launch Mystic.

Mystic may also be launched from its executable either with or without a AER file as an parameter.
