Overview
========

This base effect type can be included in the :command:`electronic_protect <electronic_protect>` or :command:`electronic_attack <electronic_attack>` technique block as one of the many available effects for a given technique. The commands listed below are the base-type commands that can be specified in the effect block for this effect type.

This effect is meant to add probability of covering a target return and a required jamming to signal (J/S) ratio that must be met in order for this effect to be applied. This effect can and is meant to be used in conjunction with the :model:`WSF_PULSE_EFFECT` and :model:`WSF_POWER_EFFECT` to apply pulse effects (i.e., :command:`jamming_pulse_density <WSF_PULSE_EFFECT.jamming_pulse_density>`) and power gain effects, respectively.

.. block:: WSF_COVER_PULSE_EFFECT

Commands
========

.. command:: probability_of_cover  <real-value>

   Specifies the the probability, in the range [0.0, 1.0], that the cover pulse is covering the skin return. A probability draw is done and if the draw is outside this probability then the effectiveness is 0.0.

   Default: 1.0

.. command:: required_j_to_s  <db-ratio-value>

   Specifies the minimum J/S ratio required for effectiveness.

   Default: 3 dB

.. command:: system_type_data  <system-type-name> ... end_system_type_data

   Input block to provide the system type (e.g., SENSOR-TYPE, JAMMER-TYPE) specific data necessary to implement this technique for a given system type. Default data can be set up for system types not defined using the "default" string as the system type.

   **<system-type-name>**
      A string input of the system-type the following data applies to, valid values are **[system-type-name | "default"]**. Default data is used for unspecified system-types and if not defined no effect will be applied for the given system-type.
