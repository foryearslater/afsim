Overview
========

WSF_ACOUSTIC_SENSOR implements a simple acoustic sensor.

This model is a simple representation of human hearing.  The model uses 1/3 octave spectral acoustic source data.
Several sources have been used to create this model.

The sound propagation, atmospheric attenuation and ground reflection have been modeled as defined in Engineering
Sciences Data Unit #78002, "*Evaluation of the Attenuation of Sound by a Uniform Atmosphere*" and #94035, "*The
Correction of Measured Noise Spectra for the Effects of Ground Reflection*."

This model has several background noise levels defined, as extracted from "*A Review of Outdoor Environmental Acoustic
Background Noise*," Charles P. Wright, Boeing document #D6-38671, 18 May 1991. Click on the chart for a higher
resolution image (Frequency is 1/3 Octave) for background noise levels.

The human hearing threshold and 1/3 octave filtering data are defined in "*Acoustics - Reference zero for the
calibration of audiometric equipment - Part 7: Reference threshold of hearing under free-flight and diffuse-field
listening conditions*," ISO 389-7:2005 and "*Technical Memorandum 3-85: Proposed Aural Nondetectability Limits for Army
Materiel*," Georges R. Garinther, Joel T. Kalb and David C. Hodge, Mar 1995, respectively.
