.. _P6DOF_Environment_Support:

P6DOF Environment Support
-------------------------

P6DOF objects require several environmental components to function properly. These include atmosphere, wind, terrain, and gravity. The use of specific environmental models for P6DOF-based objects provides a means to offer higher-fidelity models for these components than may be needed by other AFSIM objects. For example, a higher-fidelity atmosphere model may provide thermodynamic parameters that support aerodynamic heating analysis, while higher-fidelity terrain models may provide friction data that differentiates between a hard surface runway, dirt, and soft grass. A higher-fidelity gravity model may include mascons or other gravitational anomalies.

.. command:: p6dof_atmosphere <filename>

   Create a P6DOF atmosphere object using the specified file. Only a single p6dof_atmosphere object should be defined for a given scenario.
   
   See :ref:`P6DOF_Atmosphere_File_Definition` for the definition of the atmosphere file format.

.. command:: p6dof_gravity  <filename>

   Create a P6DOF gravity object using the specified file. Only a single p6dof_gravity object should be defined for a given scenario.
   
   Note: The P6DOF gravity file is a pre-planned product improvement and is not yet implemented. However, the p6dof_gravity_ command should still be used, although the specified filename will currently have no effect.

.. command:: p6dof_terrain  <filename>

   Create a P6DOF terrain object using the specified file. Only a single p6dof_terrain object should be defined for a given scenario.

   See :ref:`P6DOF_Terrain_File_Definition` for the definition of the terrain file format.
   
.. command:: p6dof_wind  <filename>

   Create a P6DOF wind object using the specified file. Only a single p6dof_wind object should be defined for a given scenario.

   Note: The P6DOF wind file is a pre-planned product improvement and is not yet implemented. However, the p6dof_wind_ command should still be used, although the specified filename will currently have no effect.

Environmental component definitions are often grouped into a single file (although this is not required). The resultant **p6dof_environment.txt** file can then be brought into a scenario using an **include_once** command. In addition to the environmental commands listed above, a :command:`p6dof_integrators` command is also typically included in the file for convenience.
