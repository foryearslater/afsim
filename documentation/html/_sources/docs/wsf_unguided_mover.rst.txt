Overview
========

:model:`WSF_UNGUIDED_MOVER` implements a mover that is capable of representing an unguided "dumb" bomb, or a single or multistage unguided rocket.  This mover derives from :model:`WSF_GUIDED_MOVER` will accept the same commands defined by it, so consult that related documentation for assistance.  This mover lacks any ability to generate a side force to maneuver to intercept a target, its "guidance" capability is disabled by default, and cannot be re-enabled, causing its trajectory to be ballistic when propulsion (if any) has burned out.
    
Commands
========

There are no additional commands recognized by this class, except for those defined in :model:`WSF_GUIDED_MOVER`.
