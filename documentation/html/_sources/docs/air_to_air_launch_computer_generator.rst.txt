Overview
========

AIR_TO_AIR_LAUNCH_COMPUTER_GENERATOR_ is a specialization of :command:`weapon_tools` to produce a
:model:`WSF_AIR_TO_AIR_LAUNCH_COMPUTER`.  The generator contains a :model:`WSF_AIR_TO_AIR_LAUNCH_COMPUTER` instance internally,
which is modified into a final output product so many of the commands are common between the two.  The launch computer
is created with a sizable matrix of air-to-air engagement conditions.  The Tool then traverses this matrix of
engagement conditions, placing an airborne shooter and target at selected conditions.  Engagement is repeated while
range is iterated upon to yield three values, a minimum, maximum, and a range of no-escape, and weapon times-of-flight
for each.  Iterations are a binary search to find the edge condition (range) at which the engagement transitions from
success to failure, or vice versa.  A weapon is fired at the target immediately after it is placed, and given a perfect
track to the target.  The missile flies out, and if kinematically possible, the target is intercepted and killed.  Note
that the Probability of Kill given sufficiently small miss distance, should be 1.0.  If the engagement results in a
target kill, the range and time of flight is saved into an array of results.  If the target is not killed (at any
range), a -1 is recorded.  The process is repeated for each engagement condition.  When all engagement results have
been recorded, the results are written into an WSF-input format text file, defining the conditions appropriate to
launch this weapon.

The engagement independent variables that affect lethal ranges in an air-to-air battle include shooter altitude and
Mach, target altitude and Mach, target Aspect angle, and target Lead angle.  Target aspect and lead are both measured
from velocity vector to line-of-sight to the other player in the engagement.  It is important to note that the matrix
of conditions to consider for engagement are held within the :model:`WSF_AIR_TO_AIR_LAUNCH_COMPUTER`, and that input
commands to it define the matrix of test conditions that this generator will consider.  This launch computer object is
aggregated within this generator object so it will accept those same commands as valid input.

.. warning::

   AIR_TO_AIR_LAUNCH_COMPUTER_GENERATOR_ does not support any launch platform with a deferred launch time.

.. _AIR_TO_AIR_LAUNCH_COMPUTER_GENERATOR.Commands:

COMMANDS
========

.. command:: minimum_range <distance-value>
   
   The shortest engagement range that will be tested. DEFAULT = 1000 meters.

.. command:: maximum_range <distance-value>
   
   The longest engagement range that will be tested. DEFAULT = 120,000 meters.

.. command:: range_tolerance <distance-value>
   
   This is a convergence test value; if two engagement ranges are found which bracket [success, failure], and they differ
   by less than the tolerance value, the transition edge is considered found.

.. command:: maximum_iterations <positive-integer>
   
   This is a terminate search constraint; if convergence is not attained within this many iterations per engagement,
   iteration is stopped for the engagement.
