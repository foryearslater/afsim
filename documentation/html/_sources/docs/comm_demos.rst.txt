group_comm_example.txt
----------------------

This simple scenario provides an example of transmitting tracks received from off-board platforms to other groups.

Scenario:

* Platform 1 (p1) is the only platform that has their sensor ON in the simulation
* Platform 1 (p1) can communicate tracks to platforms in FIGHTER_GROUP_1 (p1, p2)
* Platform 2 (p2) can communicate tracks to platforms in FIGHTER_GROUP_2 (p2, p3)
* p1 CANNOT communicate tracks to p3, but must go by way of p2

ad_hoc.txt
----------

| This scenario places ad-hoc enabled platforms randomly in a constrained area, and forms
| a network based on rules defined by the ad-hoc protocol. A high velocity ad-hoc enabled
| friendly passes through the area to highlight how linkage is created and removed between
| members during runtime. An opposing aircraft moves through the area, creating tracks that
| are reported through the network based on the resulting network topology.
|
| Network connections and resulting message transmissions are visualized using :class:`WsfDraw`.
