WSF_LINKED_PROCESSOR
--------------------

.. model:: processor WSF_LINKED_PROCESSOR

.. parsed-literal::

 processor <name> :model:`WSF_LINKED_PROCESSOR`

 end_processor

Overview
========

:model:`WSF_LINKED_PROCESSOR` is a processor with :command:`_.platform_part.internal_link` (to other
processors) and :ref:`external links <External_Link_Commands>` (to other platforms through :command:`comm`).  Although this type
has limited utility, many other processor types are derived from it, and similarly, have links.

One simple use is a radar post in which the radar reports are to be sent directly to the commander. In this case one
would have something like:

.. parsed-literal::

   platform_type RADAR_POST WSF_PLATFORM
      comm datalink :model:`WSF_COMM_TRANSCEIVER`
         ...
      end_comm

      sensor radar :model:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR`
         ...
         internal_link router
      end_sensor

      processor router :model:`WSF_LINKED_PROCESSOR`
         external_link commander via datalink
      end_processor
   end_platform_type
