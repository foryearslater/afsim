Overview
========

SAM_LAUNCH_COMPUTER_GENERATOR_ is a specialization of :command:`weapon_tools` to produce a launch computer used to fire
surface-to-air missiles.

Commands
========

.. command:: test_matrix ... end_test_matrix
   :block:

   Within this block are delineated the list of target track test conditions to be evaluated for successful missile
   intercept.  Four different arrays are to be provided:  lateral_offsets_, altitudes_, speeds_,
   and ranges_.  Each of the four arrays may be set by using the following syntax:  a) from <start-value> to
   <end-value> by <delta-value>, or b) a listing, such as <value-1> <value-2> <value-3> ... <end-value>.  All values must
   be in increasing order, but the intervals need not be even, and the from-to-by syntax and enumerated list may be used
   in combination.

   .. command:: altitudes <distance-values> end_altitudes

      The altitudes at which tracks are evaluated for intercept. Format as given in test_matrix_ above.

   .. command:: lateral_offsets <altitude-values> end_lateral_offsets

      The lateral_offsets at which tracks are evaluated for intercept. Format as given in test_matrix_ above.

   .. command:: ranges <range-values> end_ranges

      The target ground ranges at which tracks are evaluated for intercept. Format as given in test_matrix_ above.

   .. command:: speeds <speed-values> end_speeds

      The speeds at which tracks are evaluated for intercept. Format as given in test_matrix_ above.

.. command:: post_generation_interpolation_tests  ... end_post_generation_interpolation_tests
   :block:

   For debug purposes only, and is optional.  Inside this block one may place one or more lateral_offset_,
   altitude_, ground_range_, and target_speed_ specifications.  Each time the keyword 'test' appears,
   the most recent value of (offset, altitude, speed, range) is saved off as a test point, and stored into a test point
   array.  After the launch computer is generated, each of these test points will be evaluated, and the corresponding
   time-of-flight value will be printed to the screen.  The example given below saves off three points for testing.

   .. command:: lateral_offset <length-value>

      Specify the track lateral_offset of the interpolation test point.

   .. command:: altitude <length-value>

      Specify the track altitude of the interpolation test point.

   .. command:: ground_range <length-value>

      Specify the track ground_range of the interpolation test point.

   .. command:: target_speed <speed-value>

      Specify the track target speed of the interpolation test point.

   .. command:: test

      Save off the most recent values for (offset, altitude, range, and speed), and store them as a point to be interpolation
      tested.  Results will be printed to the screen.

.. command:: re_parse_produced_input_file

   After generating and writing the launch computer, re-open the file and attempt to read it back in through normal stream
   input processing.  The file is not checked by default.

.. command:: tracker_height <length-value>

   Set the height above ground for a tracking radar.  This is used in horizon masking calculations, which will disable
   weapon launch for a target engagement that is masked by curvature of earth.  If no value is input for this parameter,
   horizon masking is not considered, and missile kinematics alone are used to calculate a launch envelope.
   
.. command:: tracker_name <sensor-name>

   Alternate way to set the tracker height by specifying the sensor's name. If a tracker height wasn't specified and tracker name was, 
   the tracker height is resolved from its definition. The specified sensor must be present on the launching platform.

.. command:: tracker_elevation_limits <angle-value> <angle-value>

   Set the minimum and maximum elevation angles at which the tracking radar will function.  Target elevation angles
   outside these limits will inhibit weapon launch.

   **Default:**  -180 deg, + 180 deg (unlimited)
   
.. command:: effective_earth_radius <ratio-value>

   Set the effective earth radius ratio.  Must be greater than zero.

   **Default:**  4/3
