Type Objects and Instance Objects
---------------------------------

In order to facilitate rapid scenario development it is useful to create type objects.  A type object is a simulation
object (e.g., platform, sensor, mover) that has been populated with the desired attributes and registered as a type
object in the simulation framework.  The type object can then be used as a source to create instance objects that can
then participate directly in the simulation.  Note that type objects do not participate in the simulation.  They only
serve as a "template' from which to create concrete objects.  The concept of type objects is very powerful. 
Repositories of types can be created and stored in files which can be included as needed (using the include or
include_once commands).  Scenarios development can be reduced to simply creating instances of predefined types and
defining their initial state.
