Overview
========

:model:`WSF_INTERSECT_PROCESSOR` allows one to query a three-dimensional representation, called an intersection mesh, to
determine geometric information during a simulation.  These queries occur completely within the simulation so there is
no need to use a separate visual system.

Currently, the intersection processor is used to determine intersection geometry, occlusion, and material code for
high-energy-laser interactions with targets (see :model:`WSF_LASER_WEAPON` ).  This capability could be expanded in the
future, however, to incorporate other features such as LADAR image formation.  In order to enable these calculations,
the processor must be placed within the target's platform_type (or platform instance) definition; e.g.::

   // Example platform type for su-37
   // Once the intersect processor is defined,
   // One can make geometrical queries for intersection with
   // The target canopy and / or IRST.
   platform_type su-37 WSF_PLATFORM
      ...

Commands
========

.. command:: define_offset <string-value> <length-value> <length-value> <length-value> 
   
   Define the offset name and location on the intersection mesh associated with the target area of interest (see example
   above).

.. command:: intersect_mesh <string-value>
   
   Define the file for the intersection mesh associated with this processor.
