Overview
========

:model:`WSF_COMM_PROTOCOL_IGMP` is an emulation of basic multicasting
capabilities provided in AFSIM. This protocol is not a routing protocol,
and will not determine the correct path or the capability to send to any given
destination or group, so it must be used with another routing protocol enabled
for successful usage (such as the legacy protocol).

The multicast protocol allows comms to join multicast
groups designated by an address in the appropriate range (224.0.0.0 to 
239.255.255.255). Any subsequent transmission to an address will then be
carried appropriately by any other multicast enabled routers to the 
appropriate destinations, limiting the number of messages spawned in the process.

Note that sending multicast not only requires this protocol available from the
sender, but also the recipient, as well as any potential other comms who may
route multicast messages. Other non-multicast enabled comms will simply
"discard" the message, as they will not be able to resolve the address to an
appropriate destination.

Commands
========

.. command:: join_multicast_group <address>

   Adds this comm to the multicast group specified. Any messages sent to this
   address will attempt carrying the message to this comm, assuming no routing
   failures.

.. command:: leave_multicast_group <address>

   Removes this comm from the specified multicast group. Specifically intended
   to allow removal of indicated multicast group specification from derived comms.

.. command:: level_0_multicast

   Indicates that this multicast protocol instance is of type 0, indicating no
   actual multicast support.

.. command:: level_1_multicast

   Indicates that this multicast protocol instance is of type 1, indicating that
   this comm is capable of sending multicast messages, but cannot receive them.

.. command:: level_2_multicast

   Indicates that this multicast protocol instance is of type 2, indicating that
   this comm has full multicast capabilities, and can both send and receive
   multicast messages.
   
   This is the default setting for this protocol.
   
.. command:: join_delay <random-time-reference>

   Specifies the time required to join a multicast group, for more advanced
   modeling of network characteristics. This may also affect how other protocols
   who use multicast (such as OSPF) function, due to delayed propogation of
   multicast group data amongst routers. Future plans of script capabilities in
   joining and leaving multicast groups will be affected by this value.
   
   **Default** constant 0 script
   
.. command:: leave_delay <random-time-reference>

   Specifies the time required to leave a multicast group, for more advanced
   modeling of network characteristics. This may also affect how other protocols
   who use multicast (such as OSPF) function, due to delayed propagation of
   multicast group data amongst routers. Future plans of script capabilities in
   joining and leaving multicast groups will be affected by this value.
