Overview
========

:command:`multiresolution_multirun_table` is a structure that allows a user to specify a number of fidelity values for a list of multiresolution models (e.g., :command:`multiresolution_mover`). The table works in conjunction with the :ref:`monte carlo iteration <monte_carlo_iteration>` implementation, using the same internal ``RunNumber`` variable in order to select the row of fidelity_table_.

The Python3 module ``pyrunplotter`` (located in the ``tools`` directory) can be used to visualize and compare the outputs from multiple runs.

Commands
========

.. command:: model_list
   
   Contains a list of models to be used. The models are structured ``<platform-name> <component-type>`` for unnamed components and ``<platform-name> <component-type> <component-name>`` for named components.
   
.. command:: default_fidelity
   
   Contains a list of fidelity values to use as defaults on the list of models. If the number of runs exceeds the number of rows on ``fidelity_table`` and looping is disabled, the simulation will fall back on these default values.
   
   .. note:: If loop_after_table_end_ is enabled, this command can be omitted.
   
.. command:: fidelity_table
	
   Contains a MxN table of ``<real-value>`` entries, where M is the number of models in ``model_list`` and N is the desired number of runs. Each row in this table corresponds to a run, and each column corresponds to the model which will be assigned the column's entries.
   
.. command:: loop_after_table_end

   Tells the simulation whether to loop through the entries in ``fidelity_table``, or to fall back on the entries in ``default_fidelity`` when the number of runs exceeds the number of rows in ``fidelity_table``. If enabled, this allows users to do multiple runs of each row, which may be desired if the users want to also use randomized variables for other aspects of the simulation.
