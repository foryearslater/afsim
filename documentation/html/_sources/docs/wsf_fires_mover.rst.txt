Overview
========

:model:`WSF_FIRES_MOVER` provides movement along a ballistic trajectory that assumes a first-order drag (drag proportional
to the first power of the velocity).  The resulting trajectories are deterministic and characterized by a single
parameter.  This simplicity allows one to easily hit a location or target with a realistic time-to-impact.  These
trajectories are not as realistic as computed using full :command:`aero`, launch tables, and numerical integration, however.
This mover is most often used on a rocket, artillery, or mortar platform definition, fired from a launcher configured
with a :model:`WSF_FIRES_LAUNCH_COMPUTER` and associated
:command:`fires_tables <WSF_FIRES_LAUNCH_COMPUTER.fires_table>`.

.. block:: WSF_FIRES_MOVER

Commands
========

.. command:: remove_on_impact <boolean-value>
   
   Defines whether to remove the launched platform on impact and terminate any active weapon engagement.
   
   Default: true

.. command:: use_simple_propagation <boolean-value>
   
   Defines whether to use a simple parabolic trajectory, using only values of maximum_height_ and time_of_flight_.
   
   Default: false

.. command:: constrain_to_simple_propagation <boolean-value>
   
   In the case where a solution cannot be computed for the given values of range, max. height, and time of flight, use the
   solution given by the use_simple_propagation_ option.
   
   Default: false; the mover will relax the condition on max. height instead, in order to compute a solution.

Trajectory Commands
===================

.. note::

   Usually, one uses a :command:`fires_table <WSF_FIRES_LAUNCH_COMPUTER.fires_table>`, along with dynamically
   firing the weapon during the simulation, to specify specific trajectories.  However, one may manually configure the
   mover with these commands.

.. command:: impact_range <length-value>
   
   Defines the range from the launching platform where the munition will detonate.

.. command:: initial_bearing <angle-value>
   
   Defines the bearing from the launch platform that the munition will travel in its trajectory.

.. command:: impact_location <string-value><latitude-value><longitude-value><length-value>
   
   Specifies an impact location using a geo point reference.  For example:
      impact_location geo-point-tag 38n 90w 100 ft // altitude

.. command:: time_of_flight <time-value>
   
   Specifies the time of flight of the munition.

.. command:: maximum_height <length-value>

.. command:: maximum_ordiante <length-value>
   
   Specifies the maximum height the munition will attain in its trajectory.
