Type Browser - Wizard
---------------------

The **Type Browser** is accessible from the View menu. The browser may be docked in the left or right docking areas of the main window or be free-floating.

.. image:: ../images/wiz_type_browser.png

The browser provides a tree-view listing of all of the types that exist in the currently loaded project. The display may be expanded to show the derived types.

Double-clicking on the platform or platform-component nodes in the tree will open the command documentation for the those types.

Double-clicking on a named type will open up a :doc:`Text Editor<../wizard_text_editor>` and navigate to the appropriate definition.

The browser contains a search field at the top. Typing in this field will filter to types with names containing the value.
