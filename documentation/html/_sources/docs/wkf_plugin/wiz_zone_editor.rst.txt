Zone Editor - Wizard
--------------------

.. image:: ../images/zone_editor_header.png

The **Wizard Zone Editor** allows the user to visualize the creation and editing of zones in Wizard. With this plugin, zones can be created via right-clicking on the Map Display and selecting "Create Zone at location," as well as through the text editor.

Zone Preview
============
.. image:: ../images/preview_zone.png

While creating a zone via the Create Zone dialog, a preview of that zone will appear and change as the user updates values.

Create Zone Dialog
==================
.. image:: ../images/geometric_dialog.png

Some values will enable or disable other options in the dialog. Circular zones, for example, will have a minimum and maximum radius while elliptical zones will have axes instead.

.. image:: ../images/polygonal_dialog.png

Polygonal zones can be created by adding points with the location selector button. Points can be deleted by right-clicking on the point and selecting "Delete Point." Making the polygonal zone relative will allow setting a reference platform.

Browser
=======
.. image:: ../images/dock_widget.png

The Zone Browser dock widget allows control over which zones and zone sets are visible. Updating a zone color via the :command:`color commands<zone.fill_color>` will update the corresponding color button.
Selecting a new color via the browser will add an update to the :command:`zone<zone.fill_color>` or :command:`zone_set<zone_set.fill_color>` definition.
If the zone line or fill color is not set, it will be colored as defined in the preferences.

Preferences
===========
.. image:: ../images/pref_widget.png

From Preferences, the user can select whether each zone/set should be randomly colored or if they should all have a specified color combination.
