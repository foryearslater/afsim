Overview
========

In the WsfDraw Browser draw layers may be shown/hidden from the Map Display by checking/unchecking the individual layer or by checking "Show All".

.. image:: ../images/rv_wsf_draw.png

The browser can be put in 'extended-mode' through the 'Extended Draw Browser' option in the :doc:`Developer Menu<../mystic_developer_menu>`.  When in extended-mode the contents of a given layer may be viewed.

.. note::
   Toggling the contents of a draw layer is for debugging purposes only.  The state of a draw command will change under normal WsfDraw operation.
