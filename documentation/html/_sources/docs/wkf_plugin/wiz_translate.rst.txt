Translate Dialog - Wizard
-------------------------

The "Translate Scenario" dialog can be used to translate an entire scenario or a selection of objects.  This tool can be found in the Map Utilities menu under Tools.

.. warning:: The Translate tools are incapable of changing the position and orientation of platforms with space movers, as most of the time, the movers are not defined with the 6 degrees of freedom, but by other parameters.

The Menu
========

.. image:: ../images/wiz_translate_menu.png

The menu has the following items:

* "Translate Scenario to...":  this item sets the dialog in a mode that allows the user to translate an entire scenario to another latitude/longitude (absolute translation).
* "Translate Selection to...":  this item sets the dialog in a mode that allows the user to translate a selection of objects to another latitude/longitude (absolute translation).

.. note:: If there is nothing on the map, the menu options are disabled.

The Input Methods
=================

There are two line edits:  one for latitude and one for longitude.

.. note:: The format is d:m:s.f(N/S) for latitude, d:m:s.f(E/W) for longitude, and "v u," where v is the decimal value and u is the units for distances.  A space is between the value and unit.

It initializes the line edits as followed:

* If in the absolute translation modes, the line edits initialize with the latitude and longitude of the entire scenario/selection of objects.

There are two sliders:  one for latitude and one for longitude.  This allows the user to translate in an "animated" style.

.. note:: The sliders only translate by the degree of latitude/longitude.
