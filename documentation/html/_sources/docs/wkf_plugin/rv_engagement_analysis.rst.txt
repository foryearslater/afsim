Engagement Analysis - Mystic
----------------------------

The engagement analysis tools looks at all of the weapon engagements in a scenario.

The filters at the top allow the user to select an attacker and target platform/group.  Right clicking on a column will give options show/hide columns, plot the data in that column, export the data to a CSV file, or to trace the event.

Tracing the event attempts to find all of the events in the scenario that led up to the weapon engagement.  These will include sensor track, local tracks, tasking, and weapon events.
