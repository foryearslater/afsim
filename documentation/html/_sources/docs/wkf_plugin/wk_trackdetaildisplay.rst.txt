* In Basic Info you will find general information about your currently selected track.
* The Track Manager display will give some background on how the track came into existance.
* State Info gives detailed information on the selected tracks state as it pertains to the sim and its physical state withing the scenario.
    - The Relative Heading frame of reference is from the currently selected platform to the target.
    - The Frequency refers to the detected frequency of the track.
    - State Info also contains the Covarience Ellipsoid display. This display gives information on the statistical ellipsoid that can be drawn to represent a tracks physical location.
* Relative Geometry display gives information on the track relative to the platform currently selected in the upper left hand corner.
* Sensor Info will give a detailed look into the sensor that is attached to the currently selected platform if it has a attached sensor.
    - The LLA fields here refer to the platforms position not the platform part.
    - The Originator provides the name of platform the track originated from. If the currently selected Platform is the Originator the fields value will be true.
