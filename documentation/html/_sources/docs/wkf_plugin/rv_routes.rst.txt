Routes - Mystic
---------------

Platforms' routes may be optionally communicated from AFSIM in the :command:`event_pipe`.  Global routes will not be written to the file.

Enabling routes in the :doc:`platform options<../mystic_platform_options>` will display the current route.  Routes may change dynamically over the course of the playback.

Right clicking on a platform will provide an option ``Show Route Information`` which will display
a summary of the platform's route's waypoints.
