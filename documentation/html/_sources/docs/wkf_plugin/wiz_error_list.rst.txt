Error List - Wizard
-------------------

The **Error List** is accessible from the View menu. The Error List appears as a tab in the :ref:`Output Panel <Wizard_Main_Window.OutputPanel>` and displays errors in the loaded WSF input that Wizard has detected. The title of error list will display the number of errors detected in parenthesis. Double-clicking on a entry jumps to the location in the text editor.
