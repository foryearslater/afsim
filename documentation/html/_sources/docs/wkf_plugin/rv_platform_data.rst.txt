     - This option only appears when in the Plot View, and it will show the Data View which shows the values for all points displayed on the plot

Additionally, from the Platform Details right-click menu, the user may plot data for all platforms in one of the selected platform's groups (type, side, category). This will automatically apply a filter to the plot. The user may also manually add a filter in the plot dialog, located above the list of platforms.

Data Rings
==========

|PLATFORM_DETAILS_DATA_RING_IMAGE|

Right clicking on a numerical value also provides an option to create or remove a data ring for the selected platform. When adding a ring, the user will be presented with a dialog in which they can specifiy a desired minimum and maximum value for the ring. A platform can have any number of data rings, but only one ring per data item.


Data Displays
=============

.. image:: ../images/wkf_data_displays_prefs.png

Most items in the platform details dialog may be dragged onto the map or tether views to create a data overlay.  The overlays may be dragged around or closed using the close button which appears after hovering over the overlay.

.. note:: The preferences above will populate when the user edits the font size or color of the overlay.
