Table Plotter - Wizard
----------------------

The **Table Plotter** provides a visualization of data in :ref:`docs/table_values:Table Values`.

.. image:: ../images/wiz_table_plotter.png

It can be accessed in two ways. Right clicking on a :ref:`docs/table_values:Table Commands` or "file" command brings up a context menu with the option to plot the associated data. The second method opens an empty Table Plotter dialog via the Tools menu, where the user can then provide an AFSIM table file or csv file to plot data.

Table Plotter provides basic data display settings such as modifying axis limits and choosing which included data sets to display. In addition, right clicking the plot view opens a context menu with options for exporting data, switching views (between plot and tabular data) and displaying the legend.
