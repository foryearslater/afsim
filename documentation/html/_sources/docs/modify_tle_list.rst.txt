Modify_tle_list
---------------

**modify_tle_list** is a perl script that is released with the standard AFSIM distribution.  It converts lists of
:command:`Two-Line Elements <WSF_SPACE_MOVER.orbit>` to a standard AFSIM platform list.  This automatic conversion saves a lot
of time when dealing with inserting thousands of TLEs as AFSIM platform movers in a simulation.
modify_tle_list.pl is located in the "satellite_demos" subdirectory of the standard AFSIM distribution.
