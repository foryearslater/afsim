Preferences - Units
-------------------

.. image:: images/UnitPref.png

The Units Preferences page controls the units and precision (number of decimal places) in which different types of values should be displayed within the application. Because they are handled differently, there are additional formatting options for Latitude/Longitude and time values.

.. note:: Units preferences are shared among all AFSIM visual applications.
