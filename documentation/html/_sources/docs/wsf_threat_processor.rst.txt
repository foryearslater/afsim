Overview
========

:model:`WSF_THREAT_PROCESSOR` is a processor that watches the containing :class:`WsfPlatform`'s master track list and creates from it a list of threatening tracks based on commanded constraints. The WSF_THREAT_PROCESSOR is intended to identify incoming high-speed platforms, (i.e. missiles) but could be adapted for other purposes.

Commands
========

.. command:: threat_velocity <speed-value>

   Declares the speed in above which a track will be classified as a threat.

   **Default:** 600 m/s

.. command:: threat_angle_spread <angle-value>

   Declares the width of the angle in front of the platform within which it may consider a track threatening.

   **Default:** 30 degrees

.. command:: threat_time_to_intercept <time-value>

   Declares the time to intercept limit within which a track may be considered threatening.  Based on speed and distance.

   **Default:** 60 seconds

.. command:: require_iff_foe <boolean>

   If set to true, this threat processor ignores all potential threats that don't have IFF set to FOE in their track.

   **Default:** false

.. command:: ignore_lower_altitude_threats <boolean>

   If set to true, this threat processor ignores all potential threats that are at a lower altitude and traveling downward. 

   .. note:: Take care when considering a :model:`WSF_STRAIGHT_LINE_MOVER`; they could be lower and traveling "downward" because of the curvature of the earth.

   **Default:** false

.. command:: ignore_without_location <boolean>

   If set to true, the threat processor ignores tracks that do not have location data; such tracks are always non-threatening.

   **Default:** true

.. command:: ignore_without_velocity <boolean>

   If set to true, the threat processor ignores tracks that do not have velocity data; such tracks are always non-threatening.

   **Default:** true
