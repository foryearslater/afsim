Flight Test
+++++++++++++++

Mover Creator along with Warlock give users the opportunity to test the vehicle they have designed.  This is done through the *Flight Test* page.  There are two sections to the *Flight Test* page:

* `Initial Settings`_
* 3D rendering of the vehicle

Initial Settings
=======================
In this section the user sets the desired starting location, heading and speed of the vehicle.  Specifically, the user can change the following starting parameters:

* Latitude
* Longitude
* Altitude
* Heading
* Speed

Once the user has the initial conditions set, they can launch *Warlock* by clicking the *Perform Flight Test* button.  *Warlock* then loads up a simple scenario containing the vehicle designed by the user.

The user should then press the 'play' button at the top of the *Warlock* application to observe the vehicle in flight.  Refer to the :doc:`Warlock documentation <warlock>` for more details about options available in *Warlock*.
