Overview
========

:model:`WSF_SURFACE_MOVER` implements a mover for platforms constrained to move along the surface of the water (e.g.,
ships).  This mover is similar to the :model:`WSF_GROUND_MOVER`; however, pitch and roll are set to zero by default.  A
future addition will likely include an optional sea state that will modify the pitch, roll, and altitude of associated
platforms.

Mover Commands
==============

.. command:: update_interval <time-value>

   If non-zero, specifies a periodic time interval at which the simulation will call the mover.  If zero then the mover
   will be called only when it is necessary to determine the position of the containing platform.

   Default: 0 seconds unless overridden by the specific mover implementation.

.. command:: update_time_tolerance <time-value>

   When a position update is requested by the simulation, if the time since the previous update is less than or equal to
   this value then the mover will ignore the update.

   Default: Most mover implementations define this as the time it takes to travel 1 meter at some nominal velocity that is
   appropriate for the implementation.

   .. note::

         A mover implementation may choose to ignore this command.
