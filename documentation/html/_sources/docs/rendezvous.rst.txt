Perform a maneuver to rendezvous with the given platform.  This maneuver is actually a sequence of two maneuvers: the first being an :doc:`intercept`; and the the second being a :doc:`match_velocity` maneuver.  Options are provided to optimize when the maneuver occurs, either at the earliest possible time, or with minimum delta-V expended during that time.

   .. note:: The script version of this maneuver, :class:`WsfRendezvousManeuver`, is used dynamically to intercept track locations.
   .. note:: Several conditions must be met before the maneuver can succeed.  These conditions include the following:

   * The platform must be valid at the start of the simulation.
   * The transfer orbit can only be hyperbolic if the mover executing the maneuver supports hyperbolic propagation.
   * The transfer orbit must not intersect earth.
   * When optimizing, a valid solution must exist for the provided optimization option (optimize_time_ or optimize_delta_v_).
   * The expended energy for the transfer must be less than the available delta-v.
