draw_file
---------

.. command:: draw_file <filename>
   
   Specifies that items drawn with :class:`WsfDraw` or :command:`draw` are to be saved to a .draw file.  WsfDraw output will still be
   provided over DIS or existing interfaces.  This provides a way to record a .draw file that can be opened by the IDE.
