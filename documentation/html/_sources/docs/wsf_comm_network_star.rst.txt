Overview
========

:model:`WSF_COMM_NETWORK_STAR` provides a generic network that enforces a star topology. One comm object in
this network is designated as a "hub", and all other members of the network only have bi-directional linkage
with the "hub" comm object. This guarantees no more than two hops between any members of this network. Note
that if a hub is not designated in this network, no linkage is created.

Commands
========

.. command:: comm_list ... end_comm_list

   Members of this network may be specified by identifying a comm object by its owning platform name and 
   the name of the comm. Each entry in this list is prefixed by the "member" command.

.. command:: address_list ... end_address_list

   Members of this network may be specified by identifying a comm object by its address. Each entry in this
   list is prefixed by the "member" command. This list is only available to comm objects that have specified
   addresses in input, as comms without specified addresses will be dynamically allocated at runtime.

.. command:: hub_named <string-value> <string-value>

   Specifies the star network hub comm object by its owning platform name, and the comm name. This hub
   must be a member of the network.
   
.. command:: hub_address <address-value>

   Specifies the star network hub comm object by its address. This hub must be a member of the network.
