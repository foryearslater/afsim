    This base effect type can be included in the :command:`electronic_attack` technique block as one
    of the many available effects for a given technique. The commands listed below are the base-type commands that can be
    specified in the effect block for this effect type.

.. command:: coherency_ratio  <value> 
   
   Specifies the ratio of pulses that are coherently processed by the victim's receiver. Divides the power between the
   coherent and noise jammer power by this ratio.
   
   Default: 0.0

.. command:: jamming_pulse_density  <value> 
   
   Specifies the pulse density of the jamming signal in range [0,1] to use for this radar type.
   
   Default: 0.1

.. command:: samples_per_detection  <value> 
   
   Specifies the number of pulse samples used in a single detection attempt for a target (e.g., number of Fast Fourier
   Transform, Integration bins used by the radar). Must be greater than 1.
   
   Default: :command:`number_of_pulses_integrated <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR.number_of_pulses_integrated>` for :model:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR` types, 1
   for all other types

.. command:: minimum_jammer_to_noise_threshold  <db-ratio-value> 
   
   Specifies the minimum jammer-to-noise ratio that this effect is able to effect this radar type's receiver.
   
   Default: 0.0 dB 

.. command:: jammer_gain_table  ... end_jammer_gain_table
   :block:
   
   This block defines the jammer gain this effect exhibits as a function of the jammer-to-noise ratio and the pulse
   density present (i.e., achieved from the input jammer pulse density) in the victim's receiver.

   .. command:: jammer_to_noise_ratio  <db-ratio-value> 
   
       Specifies the jammer-to-noise ratio the following set of pulse_density_to_jamming_gain_
       is valid for. This input can be repeated for
       multiple jammer-to-signal input values as required.
       
       Default: 0.0 dB

   .. command:: pulse_density_to_jamming_gain  <ratio> <db-ratio-value>
   
       Specifies the jammer power gain factor on the receiver for the achieved pulse density at the victim receiver. This
       input can be repeated for multiple pulse_density_to_jamming_gain input values for a given jammer_to_noise_ratio as
       required. Pulse density input range [0.0,...1.0]. The gain lookup values are interpolated for pulse density's that fall
       between two values in the table. A pulse_density of 0.0 is automatically mapped to a jammer_gain of -300.0 dB in the
       tables but can be overridden by the input.
       
       Default: 0.1 0.0 dB


.. end::

.. command:: system_type_data  <system-type-name> ... end_system_type_data 
    :block:

    Input block to provide the system type (e.g., SENSOR-TYPE, JAMMER-TYPE) specific data necessary to implement this
    technique for a given system type. Default data can be set up for system types not defined using the "default" string
    as the system type.

    <system-type-name>
        A string input of the system-type the following data applies to, valid values are
        **[system-type-name | "default"]**. Default data is used for unspecified system-types and if not defined no effect will
        be applied for the given system-type.
