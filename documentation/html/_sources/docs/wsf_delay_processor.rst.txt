Overview
========

:model:`WSF_DELAY_PROCESSOR` is used simulate that it takes a finite amount of time to process information. When the
processor receives a message (e.g., image, track) it will hold the message to simulate processing time and then forward
the message via its internal and external links.

Typically, the initial producer of a message such as a sensor would link itself to this processor and this processor
would link itself to the consumers.

Commands
========

.. command:: queuing_method [ first_in_first_out | last_in_first_out | none ]
   
   Specifies how incoming messages are to be queued if all of the servers are busy. A value of **none** indicates the
   message will be discarded.
   
   Default: first_in_first_out

.. command:: number_of_servers [ <integer> | infinite ]
   
   Specifies the maximum number of messages that can be 'in process' at any given instant of time. If a new message is
   received and all of the servers are busy, the message will be queued according to the queuing_method_
   
   If 'infinite' is specified (the default), received messages are simply delayed by the required amount before being
   forwarded.
   
   Default: infinite

.. command:: time_distribution constant time <time-value>
   
   Defines that simulated processing time will a constant value with the specified time.
   
   Default: The default **time_distribution** is 'constant time 0 seconds'

.. command:: time_distribution uniform minimum_time <min-time-value> maximum_time <max-time-value>
   
   Defines that the simulated processing time for a message will be drawn from a uniform distribution with the specified
   range.

.. command:: time_distribution gaussian mean_time <mean-time-value> sigma_time <sigma-time-value>
   
   Defines that the simulated time for a message will be drawn from a Gaussian distribution with the specified mean and
   standard deviation.

.. command:: time_distribution log_normal mean_time <mean-time-value> sigma_time <sigma-time-value>
   
   Defines that the simulated time for a message will be drawn from a log-normal distribution with the specified mean and
   standard deviation.
