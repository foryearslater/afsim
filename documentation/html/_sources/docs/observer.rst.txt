Overview
========

The observer block allows the user to capture specific platform interaction data at the simulation level. It can be used as an alternative to capturing events using the event log to create user defined output information (such as comma delimited data).  It is up to the user to create the necessary scripts to capture the desired interaction information as well as the output format.  The observer block and scripts are defined outside of any platform definitions.

Commands
========

.. command:: enable <EVENT_TYPE> [ <user defined script name> ]
.. command:: disable <EVENT_TYPE> [ <user defined script name> ]

   Enable or disable a script observer for the specified **<EVENT_TYPE>**.  If the <user defined script name> is the same
   as the **<EVENT_TYPE>** actual script name, the <user defined script name> is not required. Not all of the information
   that is printed with the :command:`event_output` command is available to the observer.

.. note::
   Multiple scripts can be enabled for the same **<EVENT_TYPE>**

Events
======
The following are the values for **<EVENT_TYPE>** that can be enabled or disabled, and the corresponding script signature:
