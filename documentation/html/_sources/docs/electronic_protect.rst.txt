<type-name>
   Name of an existing Electronic Protect type or :model:`WSF_ELECTRONIC_PROTECT`, whose definition will be
   used as the initial definition of the new instance.

Overview
========

electronic_protect defines an electronic protect (counter-countermeasure) capability for a receiver.  An
:command:`electronic attack (EA) <electronic_attack>` - :command:`electronic protect (EP) <electronic_protect>` architecture provides the
ability to define EA and EP techniques and assess the interaction of these techniques.  Multiple techniques and effects
are allowed for both EA and EP capability blocks.  EP techniques defined in the receiver block mitigate EA techniques
defined in transmitter blocks. Mitigating behavior for false targets is also accomplished with the
:command:`false_target_screener`.

Commands
