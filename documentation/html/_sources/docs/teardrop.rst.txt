Perform a maneuver that brings the executing platform onto an orbit that, relative to the target_platform_ of the maneuver, appears to have a teardrop shape. The parameters that specify the relative motion are a distance at the point of closest approach (POCA), and the time it takes the executing platform to traverse the teardrop.

In addition to the final relative motion, the executing platform will perform maneuvers similar to a
:doc:`rendezvous` to transfer from its initial orbit to the final teardrop orbit. Because of this transfer,
this maneuver also has many options that overlap with :doc:`rendezvous`.

See :doc:`Teardrop Orbit <teardrop_details>` for details.

.. note:: This following conditions cannot be used with this maneuver: :command:`ascending_radius`, :command:`descending_radius`, :command:`northern_intersection`, and :command:`southern_intersection`.

Commands
********

.. command:: target_platform <string-value>

   Specify the platform relative to which the executing platform will perform a Teardrop maneuver.

.. command:: radial_offset_at_poca <length-value>

   Specify the distance at the point of closest approach. This distance will be entirely in the radial direction, with a positive value indicating that the teardrop will be above the target_platform_. The provided value must be non-zero.

.. command:: period <time-value>

   Specify the time taken to execute the teardrop maneuver. This period must be no greater than about 40.6 percent of the orbital period of the target_platform_. The period_ covers from when the executing platform first passes directly under (over) the target, and when it passes under (over) the target for the last time. These times are at half the given period_ before the point of closest approach and half the period_ after the point of closest approach.

.. command:: time_to_poca <time-value>

   Specify the duration after the executing platform is inserted onto the teardrop orbit at which it reaches the point of closest approach to the target_platform_. This value must be greater than half of the specified period_.

.. command:: repetitions <integer-value>

   Specify the number of times the executing platform should traverse the teardrop. This provided value must be positive.

   **Default**: 1
