Overview
========

:model:`WSF_COMM_ROUTER_PROTOCOL_MULTICAST` provides a generic routing capability
for multicast messaging. Specifically, this protocol allows the resolution of
multicast messages to intended recipients, and ensures that messages are only
forwarded and/or replicated as necessary to reach all potential recipients.

This protocol is a router protocol, but is NOT a routing protocol in the traditional sense.
This protocol does not provide the routing logic for intended multicast group members, and
relies on other protocols existing on the router to provide the routing for messages. As such,
this protocol by itself must have an another protocol present on the router to provide routing
or multicast message transmissions will not succeed.

Also note that this protocol allows the sending of multicast messages, but does not provide
reception capabilities. Any interface intended to receive multicast messages must also
have a method of identifying and accepting multicast messages such as those provided via
the comm protocol :model:`WSF_COMM_PROTOCOL_IGMP`.

This protocol has no additional input at this time.
