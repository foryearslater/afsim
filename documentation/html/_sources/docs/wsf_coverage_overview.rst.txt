Coverage Overview
-----------------

AFSIM's coverage capability collects the time history of interactions between
grid points and other platforms, and post processes that information into
measures of effectiveness (MOEs). This summary data can then be processed further,
displayed, or used to make design decisions.

There are a few main concepts for AFSIM's coverage capability: the coverage grid,
which is the specification of the locations of interest for the MOE; the measure
of effectiveness, which is the measurement being performed by the coverage
computation; and the coverage computation itself, which ties together a grid,
and a number of MOEs into a computation. Users wishing to perform a coverage
computation will need to specify a :doc:`grid <wsf_coverage_grid>` and a :command:`coverage`
in their input.

A :command:`coverage` computation monitors interactions between two sets of
platforms in a simulation, and produces summary statistics of those
interactions, MOEs. The interactions monitored will vary
for each type of coverage (for example, :model:`WSF_SENSOR_COVERAGE` monitors
sensor interactions), but the monitored interactions always connect assets in
the simulation, one each from two groups: grid assets and free assets (often
denoted just 'assets' when that is clear from context).

Each grid asset is a platform instantiated by the simulation at one of the
grid points for the :doc:`grid <wsf_coverage_grid>` selected by the :command:`coverage`.
The user specifies an existing platform type that will be the
template for all of the created grid asset platforms.

Free assets are platforms existing in the simulation not tied to the grid (they
are 'free' to move as they will) that can participate in the interactions with
the grid assets instantiated in the simulation.

When specifying assets for a :command:`coverage` object, the user will need to
provide the name of a device (i.e., platform part) on the asset that is taking
part in the interaction. Not every device is relevant for a given
:command:`coverage` type (for example, :model:`WSF_SENSOR_COVERAGE` works with
:command:`sensor`), and selecting an incompatible type will result in
initialization errors. In some instances, a :command:`coverage` will only need
one asset in an interaction to have a device. In those instances, the other
asset can specify 'none' as their device.

A :command:`coverage` computation can include as many
:command:`measures of effectiveness<moe>` as the user requires. Each available
MOE (see :doc:`predefined_measure_types`) provides a separate way of summarizing
the interaction history between the free and grid assets.
