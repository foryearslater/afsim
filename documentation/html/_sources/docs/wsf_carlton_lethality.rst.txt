Overview
--------

The Carlton Damage Equation is most often used for indirect fire artillery engagements against fixed ground targets. Down range and cross range miss distances are assumed to occur in a more-or-less horizontal plane containing the target, and the weapon's velocity vector is used to orient the values in a near-far, right-left direction. Any Z offsets are ignored. Orientation of either the weapon or the target do not matter. This implements the Carlton lethality model as expressed by the equation:

:math:`P_k = D_0 \times e^{(\frac{-\pi D_0} {LA} \times (x^2 \times RDR + y^2 \times \frac{1} {RDR} ))}`

Where:

:math:`D_0`
   Input parameter for the weapon/target pair (defined as an input value)

:math:`LA`
   Lethal area for the weapon/target pair (defined as an input value)

:math:`AOF`
   Angle of fall of the weapon (relative to horizontal)

:math:`x`
   Downrange miss distance

:math:`y`
   Cross range miss distance

:math:`RDR = \frac{1}{1 - 0.8 \times \cos AOF}`

Commands
--------

.. warning::

   The following :command:`weapon_effects` commands are not compatible with WSF_CARLTON_LETHALITY.  Use of these commands will result in an input processing error.
   
   * :command:`weapon_effects.intercept_pk`
   * :command:`weapon_effects.launch_pk`
   * :command:`weapon_effects.use_launch_pk`
   
.. command:: d_zero <real-value>

   The value of :math:`D_0` in the range [0 .. 1].

   **Default:** 0.5

.. command:: lethal_area <target-type> <area-value>

   Specify the lethal area (LA) for a target of the specified type.  This command should be repeated for all target types to which this lethality object will be applicable.

.. note::

   If there is no lethal area defined for the target type, the munition is assumed to have NO effect on the target.
