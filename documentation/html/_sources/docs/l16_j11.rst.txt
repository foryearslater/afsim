| This directory contains the files necessary to run a weapon server demo with Link-16 network-enabled weapons.
|
| The jtids.txt file contains the JTIDS terminal and Link-16 computer definitions for both the weapon fighter platform and the network-enabled weapon.
|
| The platform.txt file contains the network-enabled weapon definition and the fighter and weapon fighter definition.
|
| For this scenario, three platforms are created a red fighter, a bogus point, and a blue weapon fighter (see j11_out.txt). At T=15s, a network-enabled weapon is fired. The blue weapon fighter then begins sending J11.1 In-Flight Target Updates (IFTUs) to the weapon.
|
| The weapon server is defined in the j11_in.txt file. The client is defined in the j11_out.txt file.
|
| Steps to run:
| * Ensure the DIS multicast address and port are acceptable (see dis_network.txt line 38).
| * Update the IP address for the weapon server (see j11_out.txt line 103).
| * If the port is changed, it must be modified on the server side as well (see j11_in.txt line 76).
| * Open two command prompt windows or two instances of Wizard.
| * If using Wizard, set the j11_in.txt file as the startup file in one instance and the j11_out.txt as the startup in the other instance.
| * Start the weapon server first (j11_in.txt).
| * Start the client (j11_out.txt).
|
| If viewing in a DIS viewer the weapon is launched and immediately turns toward the red fighter if it is receiving IFTUs from the client-side blue fighter. If there are issues with the connection settings the weapon will fly in a straight line until detonating due to max time of flight exceeded.
