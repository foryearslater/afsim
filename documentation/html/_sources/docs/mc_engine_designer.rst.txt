Engine Designer
+++++++++++++++

.. image:: images/engine_geometry.png
   :width: 400
   :align: right

The Engine Designer opens when a user creates a new engine model or edits an existing model from the Start Dialog.

This tool allows the user to define the engine(s) that will be used for his or her vehicle. Once an engine is created, it becomes available in the drop-down menu when adding/editing an engine in the :ref:`Geometry<Engine>` page. The Engine Designer may also be launched from this area (boxed in red in the image below).

The format of the Engine Designer is unique to each engine type, because each type requires a different set of specifications from the user.

Supported types include:

* :ref:`Jets<Jet_Engines>`
* :ref:`Ramjets<Ramjet_Engines>`
* :ref:`Liquid Propellant Rockets<Liquid_Propellant_Rocket_Engines>`
* :ref:`Solid Propellant Rockets<Solid_Propellant_Rocket_Engines>`

General
=======

The Engine Designer has two main areas of interaction: an engine specification editor and a plot editor. Both are unique for each engine type, but share common features. This section will explain the general behavior and commonality of the two editors. Any changes made to the engine using either editor should be saved by clicking the "Save Model" button at the bottom of the left side of the dialog, shown in the image below (boxed in blue).

.. image:: images/engine_designer.png


*Engine Specifications*
-----------------------

The left side of the screen contains a set of editable properties unique to the engine type being designed.

The specifications common to all of the engine types are listed in the table below. This group of specifications is boxed in orange in the image above with the exception of mass, which is grouped with each engine type's parameters.

.. _general_specifications_table:
.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 2

   * - General Engine Properties
     -
   * - Specification
     - Description
   * - Engine Type
     - The engine type currently being created or edited. (Read-only)
   * - Model Name
     - The engine model currently being created or edited. (Read-only)
   * - Mass
     - The mass of the engine. For solid rocket engines, options are provided for specifying the empty (casing) weight or the total mass including propellant. For all other engine types, the empty mass should be specified.
   * - Length
     - The length of the engine in feet.
   * - Diameter
     - The diameter of the engine in feet.
   * - :command:`Thrust Offset<thrust_offset>`
     - The location of the thrust relative to the engine's reference point along the x-axis in feet. A positive value is forward of the engine, negative is aft.

In addition to the specifications in the table above, each engine type has its own unique set of specifications (boxed in green). The contents of this section will change according to the engine type. The specifications for each type are explained in their respective sections below.

*Engine Plots*
--------------

On the right side of the Engine Designer window is the plot editor. The displayed plot may be changed by selecting the desired plot from the "Current Plot" drop-down menu (shown in the image above, boxed in purple). Plots update as the user changes the properties in the engine specification editor (left side).

A plot may also be modified by using the tools in the "Modify Plots" section, boxed in yellow above. Users may enter a global multiplier that will multiply the y-coordinate of all points in the plot by the specified factor. Alternatively, users may enter a global offset that will move the y-coordinate of all points in the plot by the specified amount. Once the Apply button is clicked, a new line will appear showing the modified plot data. The modified plot line is colored yellow, and the original plot line is green. If the user wishes to have more control over the shape of the plot, he or she may check the option for "Show Modifier Line". This will cause a black horizontal line to appear, the scale for which is on the right side of the plot area. Moving the individual points on this line to different values will cause the plot data to be moved by the corresponding amount. The modifier line can be toggled between "Offset" and "Multiplier". Additional points may be added to the modifier line by right clicking anywhere on the plot area and selecting "Add Modifier Point" from the menu. A dialog will appear prompting the user for the desired x-coordinate of the new point.

If the user has a set of engine data he or she wishes to use, the engine's raw .amc file may be modified to reflect the desired data. This file is in the JSON format. All of the engine's plot data is under "plots" in the file.

.. note:: The engine .amc file is structured in a specific format, and should only be modified by advanced users.

To undo changes to the plot, click "Revert Plot", located in the lower right corner of the "Modify Plots" section. This will remove all modifications done to the current plot and restore the plot as it was before the Engine Designer was launched.

The plot view may be changed to a data view by right-clicking on the plot area and selecting "Data View". Once in the data view, the user may go back to plot view by right clicking and selecting "Plot View" from the menu. The data may also be exported to .csv by right-clicking and selecting "Export Data". The image below shows the data view of the plot shown above.
