An orbital propagator determines the future kinematic state (position and velocity) of a space platform based on a given initial state.  Propagators are utilized in AFSIM to model the orbital motion of satellites with space movers (e.g., see :model:`WSF_SPACE_MOVER`), as well as to track estimated satellite locations (e.g., see :doc:`orbit determination fusion<orbit_determination_fusion>`).

Propagator Types
================

See :ref:`Predefined_Propagator_Types` for a list of available propagator types.
