Overview
========

:model:`WSF_BALLISTIC_LAUNCH_COMPUTER` implements a launch computer for an unguided weapon, such as a gravity bomb or
unguided rocket. The weapon may have various engagement constraints that must be satisfied prior to launch of the
:model:`WSF_EXPLICIT_WEAPON`.

The :command:`weapon_tools` application assists with creation of launch computers of this type.
(See :command:`BALLISTIC_LAUNCH_COMPUTER_GENERATOR`). The generated output product is a table providing
the downrange travel and time of flight of a weapon dropped from a particular altitude and speed, which allows a
future weapon release to be anticipated to place the impact location as desired.

.. block:: WSF_BALLISTIC_LAUNCH_COMPUTER

Commands
========

.. warning::
   Ordering of the following commands is important. Launch altitudes, launch speeds, and target altitudes must
   be defined before the time-of-flight and down range values.

.. command:: launch_altitudes <minimum-altitude> <delta-altitude> <number-of-altitudes>

   Specifies the :argtype:`minimum launch altitude <length-value>`, the :argtype:`altitude increment <length-value>`
   and :argtype:`number of altitudes <integer-value>` that constitute the intercept envelope. Altitudes are assumed
   to be the height of the launcher above an ellipsoidal earth.

   .. note::
      The number of altitudes must be greater than 1 and the altitude increment must be greater than 0.0.

.. command:: launch_speeds <minimum-speed> <delta-speed> <number-of-speeds>

   Specifies the :argtype:`minimum launch speed <speed-value>`, the :argtype:`speed increment <speed-value>`
   and :argtype:`number of launch speeds <integer-value>` that constitute the intercept envelope.

   .. note::
      The number of speeds must be greater than 1 and the speed increment must be greater than 0.0.

.. command:: target_altitudes <minimum-altitude> <delta-altitude> <number-of-altitudes>

   Specifies the :argtype:`minimum target altitude <length-value>`, the :argtype:`altitude increment <length-value>`
   and :argtype:`number of altitudes <integer-value>` that constitute the intercept envelope. Altitudes are assumed
   to be the height of the target above an ellipsoidal earth.

   .. note::
      The number of altitudes must be greater than 1 and the altitude increment must be greater than 0.0.

.. command:: times_of_flight_values ...

   The time-of-flight value for the weapon, when released at the specified launch altitude, target altitude and launch
   speed.  The number of value given must equal the number of launch altitudes X number of target altitudes X number of
   launch speeds, and the latter indices cycle faster than the former (typical "matrix" order).

   .. note::
      The values entered must be in seconds.

.. command:: downrange_values ...

   The down range distance from launch location to impact location, when the weapon is released at the specified launch
   altitude, target altitude and launch speed.  The number of values provided must equal the number of launch altitudes X
   number of target altitudes X number of launch speeds, and the latter indices cycle faster than the former (typical
   "matrix" order).

   .. note::
      The values entered must be in meters.
