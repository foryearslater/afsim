| This demonstrates the use of WSF_NOISE_CLOUD.  It defines a noise
| cloud layer and uses it to affect detections of an air target from
| a radar.  This demo uses sensorplot.
|
| noise_cloud.txt
| We generate a horizontal map of probability of detection around a radar.
| The cloud layer is defined, and is given a sensor_modifier.  The sensor
| uses this modifier with the modifier_category command in its definition.
| Adjust the values in the noise_cloud to see how they affect the structure
| of the cloud layer.
|
| output\noise_cloud.tiff
| This is the output that will be generated after executing with sensor_plot.
| It may be viewed in wizard by double-clicking on it in the project browser.
