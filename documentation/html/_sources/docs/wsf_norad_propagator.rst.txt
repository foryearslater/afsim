Overview
========

:model:`WSF_NORAD_PROPAGATOR` implements a propagator for a platform in orbit about the Earth.  It is useful for modeling
satellites for which :command:`two-line element (TLE)<WSF_NORAD_PROPAGATOR.orbit>` sets are available, including most operational Earth-orbiting satellites, non-operational satellites, and actively-tracked orbiting debris.

The propagator implements propagation algorithms as defined in the document *SpaceTrack Report No. 3* (https://www.celestrak.com/NORAD/documentation/spacetrk.pdf) .  This report provides algorithms that define several models; the propagator selects the appropriate model (NORAD SGP, SGP4, SGP8, SDP4, or SDP8) for propagation depending on the data provided in the two-line element.  Oblate earth, drag, and third-body Sun and Moon perturbation effects are taken into account by these models.
