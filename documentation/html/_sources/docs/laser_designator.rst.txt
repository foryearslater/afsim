| A Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) (aka forward observer) assigned with blue troops 
| designate a red APC coming up over a hill. The designation is communicated to a UAV.
| The UAV flies toward the target (APC) until it is within range to fire a Hellfire missile.
| A couple of more APC's are designated and fired at once they are designated by the JTAC.
| 
| It is best to have dted defined for the area in a terrain.txt file.
| (The dted file is too large to be provided with this demo).
