Overview
--------

This is a specialized lethality that applies damage based on energy deposition by a High-Energy Laser (HEL) weapon
(:model:`WSF_LASER_WEAPON` or :model:`WSF_CUED_LASER_WEAPON`).
Lethality can be defined with respect to a region, target type, or category designation.  Regions are specified areas
on platforms.  Currently these only have meaning when referring to defined lethal areas on an intersection mesh and
defined in a :model:`WSF_INTERSECT_PROCESSOR` on the target.   platform_type definitions apply to all targets of the given
type.  Category definitions apply to all targets that have been tagged with the given :command:`platform.category`.

.. note::

   In order to define custom scripted effects on target regions, implement either
   :command:`weapon_effects.on_target_damaged` or :command:`weapon_effects.on_target_killed`.

Commands
--------

.. attention::

   The following :command:`weapon_effects` commands are not compatible with WSF_HEL_LETHALITY.  A warning will be issued when attempting to use these commands.

   .. hlist::
      :columns: 2
	  
      * :command:`weapon_effects.intercept_pk`
      * :command:`weapon_effects.launch_pk`  
      * :command:`weapon_effects.use_intercept_pk`
      * :command:`weapon_effects.use_launch_pk`


.. command:: damage_radius <length-value> 
   
   Specifies the radius over which the beam is effective.  If this is smaller than the beam size, only that part of the
   beam incident within the circular region will be used for lethality calculations.  If it is larger than the beam size,
   the entire beam will be used.  If specified, the area represented by the damage radius will be used in the energy
   density calculation.  If not specified, the full beam size will be used in the energy density calculation.
   
   Default: Not specified (the beam size is used) 

.. command:: minimum_energy <energy-value>
   
   Specifies the minimum energy deposition on target necessary to apply the lethality to the target.

.. command:: minimum_energy_density  <fluence-value> 
   
   Specifies the minimum energy density (in j/cm^2 or equivalent) deposition on target necessary to apply the lethality to
   the target.

.. command:: pk_energy_table  table 
   
   Define a probability of kill vs. threshold energy table.
   The table should have the following form::
   
     *number-of-rows*
     *p-k_1 energy-threshold_1*
     *p-k_2 energy-threshold_2*
     *...*
     *p-k_n energy-threshold_n*
   
   A simple example is as follows::
   
     pk_energy_table
        5
        0.1 1 kj
        0.3 2 kj
        0.5 3 kj
        0.7 4 kj
        0.9 5 kj
      end_pk_energy_table
   
   Energy thresholds should be listed in increasing order.
   A p-k draw will be made after each :command:`WSF_LASER_WEAPON.firing_update_interval` during the engagement.  The reference p-k value will be interpolated from the table
   depending on the current cumulative energy deposition on target.  If the draw is less than the the reference value, the
   effect of the lethality will be processed.
   
   .. note:: Changing the associated weapon's :command:`WSF_LASER_WEAPON.firing_update_interval` will affect the overall probability of kill when using the pk_energy_table_. More p-k draws will be made with decreasing :command:`WSF_LASER_WEAPON.firing_update_interval` (effect is more likely overall), and fewer p-k draws will be made with increasing :command:`WSF_LASER_WEAPON.firing_update_interval` (effect is less likely overall).

General Commands
----------------

.. command:: manage_kills <boolean-value> 
   
   Tells the simulation whether it can kill and remove platforms.
   For an API-based simulation, this should be disabled,
   otherwise, it should be enabled.
   
   Default: true
