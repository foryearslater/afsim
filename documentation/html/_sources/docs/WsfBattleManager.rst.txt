Overview
========

**WsfBattleManager** is the script interface for invoking methods on the
IADS C2 battle manager base class. This class provides common interfaces
that all IADS C2 battle managers derive.

Methods
=======

.. method:: void RunModel()

   Runs the model for the current update cycle. This generally means that the battle managers will run their threat to assignment loops possibly creating pending outgoing messages for a C\ :sup:`2` Dissemination processor to dispatch.

.. method:: bool HasCommitAuthority()

   Returns true if the battle manager has been scripted with **commit_authority** on, otherwise false.
