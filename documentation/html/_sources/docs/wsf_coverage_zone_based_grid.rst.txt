Overview
========

The :model:`WSF_ZONE_BASED_GRID` is a coverage grid with a regular arrangement
of points in latitude and longitude, but with a boundary given by a user-specifiable
zone. The separation between points in the grid
is specified by angles in latitude and longitude. The north-south and east-west
directions can have their separations set independently. The altitude of the
grid is fixed, and can be specified.

Commands
========

.. command:: zone <global-zone-name>

   Specify that the boundary of the grid should match the boundary for the
   global zone with the name **<global-zone-name>**.

.. command:: spacing <angle-value>

   Set the spacing between grid points in both latitude and longitude,
   but only if those spacings have not been set in some other way (latitude_spacing_,
   or longitude_spacing_).

.. command:: latitude_spacing <angle-value>

   Set the spacing between adjacent latitudes for this grid. If both latitude_spacing_
   and spacing_ are defined, the value provided with latitude_spacing_ will be
   used.

.. command:: longitude_spacing <angle-value>

   Set the spacing between adjacent longitudes for this grid. If both longitude_spacing_
   and spacing_ are defined, the value provided with longitude_spacing_ will be
   used.

.. command:: origin <latitude-value> <longitude-value>

   Set the origin on the point in the grid. The origin is the point from which
   the other points are spaced in latitude and longitude. The origin must be
   within the latitude and longitude rectangle that bounds the zone_ specified
   for this grid. The default value of the grid's origin point is the centroid
   of the zone_.

.. command:: altitude <length-value> <altitude-reference>

   Set the altitude of the grid points. **<altitude-reference>** can be either
   '**msl**', in which case the altitude refers to a height above the mean sea level,
   or '**agl**', in which case the altitude refers to a height above the ground level
   set by any terrain in the scenario.

.. command:: asset <platform-type> <device-name>

   Specify the assets associated with this grid will be instances of
   **<platform-type>** and will use the device with the name **<device-name>**.
   The given **<device-name>** may also be 'none' if the
   grid points are passive targets for the coverage computation in question.
