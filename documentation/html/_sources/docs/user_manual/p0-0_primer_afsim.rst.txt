Overview
--------

The **Advanced Framework for Simulation, Integration and Modeling (AFSIM)** is an object-oriented C++ library that is used to create simulations that model platform interactions in a geographic context.
Top-level objects in the simulation are called platforms (a.k.a. bodies, entities or players).  Think of a platform as a simple body to which systems and attributes are attached.
Platforms represent such things as vehicles (ground, air, space, surface, subsurface), buildings, or living beings. Interactions include sensor detections, collisions, and communications to name a few.
