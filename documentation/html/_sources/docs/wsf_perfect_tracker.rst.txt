Overview
========

:model:`WSF_PERFECT_TRACKER` is used to simulate a perfect seeker or perfect command guidance. It
simply updates the platform 'current target track' to correspond to the truth target platform that was handed to the
host platform.  The 'current target track' is often used by guidance computers such as WSF_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER and
WSF_HARM_GUIDANCE to determine the intercept point for navigation purposes.
