Overview
--------

Define weapon effectiveness by creating a new or editing an existing weapon effects type.

Creating a weapon_effects type
==============================

A weapon_effects command that occurs outside of a **platform(_type)** definition will create a new *weapon_effects
type*.

::

 weapon_effects <new-type-name> <base-type-name>
    weapon_effects subcommands
 end_weapon_effects

* <new-type-name> : Name of the new weapon_effects type to be created. This must be unique among all the weapon_effects
  types.
* <base-type-name> : Name of an existing or predefined weapon_effects type whose definition will be used as the initial
  definition of the new type.

Subcommands
^^^^^^^^^^^

:Any of the Subcommands valid for *<base-type-name>*.

Using a weapon_effects type
===========================

A weapon_effects command that occurs inside a weapon(_type) definition indicates that engagement results for the weapon
should be computed using the indicated weapon_effects type

::

 weapon
   weapon_effects <type-name>
 end_weapon

<type-name> 
    Name of an existing or predefined weapon_effects type whose definition will be used to create the new instance.
