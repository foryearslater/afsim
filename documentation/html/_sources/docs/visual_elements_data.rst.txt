Visual Elements Data
=====================
.. parsed-literal::

   visual_elements
      poi_ <poi-name> ... 
      decoration_ <entity-name> ...
      range_ring_ <ring-name> ...
   end_visual_elements

.. command:: visual_elements ... end_visual_elements

   Visual elements blocks contain three types of map annotations: points-of-interest, decorations and range rings. Although they have no bearing on the simulation itself, these map annotations can significantly improve the user experience in AFSIM visual applications.

   .. warning:: Points of interest and platforms are commonly referred to as ***entities***. Range rings and decorations are attached to entities, which are referenced by name. Please avoid having multiple entities with the same name because this may cause unintended behavior. 

* Points-of-interest are small markers used to keep track of important locations. 
* Decorations are text or image attachments that may be added to platforms or points-of-interest. 
* Range rings are a set of concentric circles labeled by distance from a central point (platform or point-of-interest) that can be useful for visualizing effects such as weapon ranges. 

Each of these command blocks are detailed below. 

Point-Of-Interest
==================
Each point-of-interest has a name, a position, an altitude and a bullseye flag. 

.. command:: poi <name> ... end_poi

   .. parsed-literal::
      
      poi <string>
         position_ ...
         altitude_ ...
         bullseye_
      end_poi

.. command:: position <latitude-value> <longitude-value>

   Specifies the latitude and longitude of the point-of-interest. 

   **Default** 0n 0e

.. command:: altitude <length-value> 

   Specifies the altitude of the point. 

   **Default** 0 m

.. command:: bullseye 

   This flag determines whether the point-of-interest will be displayed as a bullseye instead.  

Decoration 
===========
Each decoration has an entity name, which represents the entity that it is attached to. The inside of the block contains a description of what should be drawn on the map.  

.. command:: decoration <name> ... end_decoration

   .. parsed-literal::

      decoration <string> 
         text_ ...
         preset_ ...
         image_ ...
      end_decoration 

.. command:: text <string> 

   Specifies the text that should be displayed on the entity.

.. command:: preset <PresetType>

   Specifies the preset image that should be displayed on the entity. The possible choices are one, two, three, four, heart, diamond, spade and club. 

.. command:: image <string>

   Specifies the file path of the image that should be displayed on the entity.

   .. note:: The three decoration description commands are mutually exclusive. Only the most recent command will be considered when drawing the decoration.

Range Ring 
===========
Every range ring block has a unique name. The inside of the block contains a description of how the ring should be drawn, as well as the name of the entity it should be attached to.

.. command:: range_ring <name> ... end_range_ring 

   .. parsed-literal::

      range_ring <string>
         entity_ ...
         show_range_labels_ 
         range_label_color_ ...
         ring_color_ ...
         ring_width_ ...
         center_radius_ ...
         additional_rings_ ...
         additional_radii_ ...
         show_angle_labels_
         angle_label_color_ ...
         radial_color_ ...
         radial_width_ ...
         center_angle_ ...
         angle_width_ ...
         radial_rate_ ...
         align_north_ 
      end_range_ring 

.. command:: entity <string> 

   Specifies the name of the entity that the range ring should be attached to.

.. command:: show_range_labels
   
   This flag determines whether range labels should be visible. 

.. command:: range_label_color <color-value> 

   Specifies the color of the range labels.

   **Default** white

.. command:: ring_color <color-value> 

   Specifies the color of the rings.

   **Default** white

.. command:: ring_width <integer>

   Specifies the line width of the rings.

   **Default** 1

.. command:: center_radius <length-value>

   Specifies the radius of the innermost range ring.

   **Default** 111120 m

.. command:: additional_rings <integer> 

   Specifies the number of additional rings that should be drawn.

   **Default** 0

.. command:: additional_radii <length-value> 

   Specifies how much longer the radius is for each additional ring

   **Default** 18520 m

.. command:: show_angle_labels 

   This flag determines whether angle labels should be visible.

.. command:: angle_label_color <color-value>

   Specifies the color of the angle labels.

   **Default** white

.. command:: radial_color <color-value>

   Specifies the color of the radial lines.

   **Default** white

.. command:: radial_width <integer> 

   Specifies the line width of the radial lines. 

   **Default** 1

.. command:: center_angle <angle-value>

   Specifies the zero-angle offset of the ring (relative to the attached entity's heading).

   **Default** 0.0 degrees

.. command:: angle_width <angle-value>

   Specifies the span of the ring. 

   **Default** 360 degrees 

.. command:: radial_rate <angle-value>

   Specifies the rate at which radial lines will be drawn. 

   **Default** 0 degrees 

.. command:: align_north

   By default, the zero-angle offset of the ring is relative to the entity's heading. This flag aligns it with true north instead.
