Overview
--------

Mystic (renamed from Results Visualization as of release 2.7.0) is a tool that is used to visualize the recorded results of an AFSIM simulation :command:`event_pipe`. It reads in AFSIM event recordings (AER) files generated by the simulation and displays them in a geographic context. It can be launched from Wizard by double clicking on a generated AER file, or as a standalone application.
