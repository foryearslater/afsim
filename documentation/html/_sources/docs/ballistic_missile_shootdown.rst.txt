| UNCLASSIFIED
| Any resemblance or approximations to actual weapon system capabilities 
| in this demo are purely accidental.  The intent of this DEMONSTRATION is 
| to illustrate how to setup a processor to launch an anti-ballistic missile 
| at sometime in the future to intercept a ballistic missile.
| (processors/anti_ballistic_missile_processor.txt)
| For the demo, a red_mrbm_1 is launched from Ontario Canada at Washington DC. An anti 
| ballistic missile (in this case a blue_naval_sam) is fired to intercept the 
| red_mrbm_1(s) to save Washington. 
| 
| The top startup file to run is "ballistic_shootdown.txt".  
| This is a one on one example. 
| 
| The "many_ballistic_shootdown.txt" is another top startup file
| that depicts a nine against nine shootdown by only changing out 
| the scenario files. Take note that there are nine launchers for the red_mrbm_1's
| and only six for the blue_naval_sam's.  One of the launchers has more than one weapon.
| 
| The command "show_graphics" provides output for Mystic concerning 
| the interceptor evaluation criteria on the ballistic path of what is being 
| evaluated to be shot down.  (The show_graphics subcommand is located within the 
| WSF_GUIDANCE_COMPUTER block on the weapon.)
|   An orange dot is created at the time of evaluation.
|   A green dot is displayed at the target location when the interceptor will launch.
|   A red dot at the point of possible intercepts
|   A white dot shows the last possible intercept location.
|   A yellow dot shows the final location of the weapon intercept.
