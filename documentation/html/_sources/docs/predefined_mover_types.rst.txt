Route Types
^^^^^^^^^^^

These movers are simplified movers in that routes with waypoints can be defined in order for them to move from position to position during the simulation. Limits defined on a platform restrict their movement. Platform movement is based on mathematics and not necessarily by aero or mass properties of the platform.

* :model:`WSF_AIR_MOVER`
* :model:`WSF_GROUND_MOVER`
* :model:`WSF_KINEMATIC_MOVER`
* :model:`WSF_ROAD_MOVER`
* :model:`WSF_ROTORCRAFT_MOVER`
* :model:`WSF_SURFACE_MOVER`
* :model:`WSF_TSPI_MOVER`

Follower Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These movers become 'attached' to the Route Type Movers and are used to have a platform instance 'follow' other platforms.

* :model:`WSF_HYBRID_MOVER`
* :model:`WSF_OFFSET_MOVER`
