UCI_ElevationScanStabilization
------------------------------

.. class:: UCI_ElevationScanStabilization

Overview
========

This type is used to define whether the new elevation center is referenced by the body or center altitude. The center of the volume
can be stabilized either relative to the boresight of the antenna installation on the aircraft (BODY) or relative to a location
defined by the Elevation Scan Center Altitude Range Pair (CENTER_ALTITUDE). In either case, the radar will position the volume
alignment relative to the aircraft's current pitch.

Static Methods
==============

.. method:: static UCI_ElevationScanStabilization BODY()

   Returns a UCI_ElevationScanStabilization_ with the BODY reference type.

.. method:: static UCI_ElevationScanStabilization CENTER_ALTITUDE()

   Returns a UCI_ElevationScanStabilization_ with the CENTER_ALTITUDE reference type.
