Overview
========

:model:`WSF_N_ASSET_COVERAGE_MOE` computes quantities related to the number of
free assets that can be accessed by a grid point at a time.

Computation Subtype
===================

.. command:: subtype <sub-type> [<parameter>]

   Specify the computation subtype. 

   :model:`WSF_N_ASSET_COVERAGE_MOE` has the following subtypes that take no parameter:
   following subtypes that take no parameter:

   * **minimum** - The measured value will be the minimum number of free assets accessed simultaneously by the grid point in question.
   * **maximum** - The measured value will be the maximum number of free assets accessed simultaneously by the grid point in question.
   * **mean** - The measured value will be the mean number of free assets accessed simultaneously by the grid point in question.
   * **unique** - The measured value will be the total number of unique free assets accessible by the grid point in question throughout the whole coverage interval.

   :model:`WSF_N_ASSET_COVERAGE_MOE` supports the following subtype that takes an
   input parameter specifying a percentage value, which must be greater than 0
   and less than 100.

   * **percent_above** - For <parameter> percent of the coverage interval, the grid point in question accesses more free assets than the computed value.
