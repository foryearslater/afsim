WSF 1.5.2 - 9 February 2009
---------------------------

Corrections
===========

* **(CRITICAL)** Due to some erroneous information, a change was made to **WSF_IR10T_SENSOR** in :ref:`wsf_1.5.1` that
  should not have be made. The format of the transmissivity tables was assumed to be incorrect, when in fact the tables
  used to diagnose the problem were incorrect. The transmissivity table lookups have been restored to their previous
  forms.

* **(CR 6247)** A program compiled in 64-bit mode would abort with a segmentation fault. The random number generator
  was  updated to operate correctly when compiled in 64-bit mode.

* **(CR 6258)** Fixed a problem where a :command:`terrain` query using a visual database (i.e. when using the
  :command:`terrain.visual_db` command) would crash if the requested location was not in the visual database and there was
  not a DTED database that covered the missing area. The use of these two database types were supposed to be mutually
  exclusive. This change will eliminate searching for DTED if a visual database is in use.

* **(CR 6262)** Fixed an issue in :command:`antenna_pattern steered_array_pattern <antenna_pattern>` when a linear array
  (i.e. number_elements_x or number_elements_y is equal to 1) was defined the gain being returned was the minimum gain as
  it was not being calculated correctly. Fixed issue in the calculation of the array gain where the number of elements
  was being negated by 1 to calculated the aperture area. No longer negate the number of elements by 1 in the calculation.

Enhancements
============

* Modified :command:`weapon_effects` to allow script definitions, and in particular, the definition of a
  'on_weapon_target_engagement' script. If defined, this script will be invoked when the final effect of the weapon on a
  target needs to be determined. The script can examine the conditions and determine if the probability of kill should be
  degraded. This replaces the former undocumented mechanism which allowed definition of the script on the weapon (that
  method is still available, but will not be documented). The new mechanism is much more flexible because it allows
  lethality changes without modifying the weapon, and also works with weapons such as lasers, etc., where the weapon is
  not a platform.

* Added capability to utilize individual float-grid files for terrain elevation lookup, instead of utilizing a directory
  structure (needed for the 'float_grid' input).  There is a new :command:`terrain` input called 'float_grid_file' that is used
  to convey individual areas of elevation.  This use of individual files is not appropriate for large areas; for that,
  use the traditional DTED, raw_dted, or float_grid directives.

* Added the capability to enter an instantaneous (analysis) bandwidth via the
  :command:`_.receiver.instantaneous_bandwidth` input command of a receiver to use in calculating the
  noise power of the receiver.

* Added the capability to define :model:`detection sensitivities <WSF_ESM_SENSOR>` for an
  :model:`WSF_ESM_SENSOR` type sensor in lieu of the :model:`detection thresholds <WSF_ESM_SENSOR>`. This
  capability allows for input of a more common method for defining the detection limits of an ESM sensor.

* Added in the capability to enter frequency-dependent and signal-type- and frequency-dependent detection threshold
  and sensitivity tables for an :model:`WSF_ESM_SENSOR` via the
  :model:`detection_threshold_table <WSF_ESM_SENSOR>` and
  :model:`detection_sensitivity_table <WSF_ESM_SENSOR>` input commands. this capability allows for
  frequency-dependent and signal-type- and frequency-dependent thresholds and sensitivities over the operation frequency
  of an ESM sensor.

* Added the capability to define :model:`system-type data <WSF_POWER_EFFECT>` for the :model:`WSF_POWER_EFFECT`
  to allow for system-type (SENSOR-TYPE) specific data values.

* Added the :method:`CueToAbsoluteAzEl <WsfArticulatedPart.CueToAbsoluteAzEl>` script method to :class:`WsfArticulatedPart`. This
  allows a sensor whose installed bore-sight is not straight ahead to be cued to an azimuth and elevation relative to the
  host platform.

* **(CR 5845)** Added an initial limited 'strip map' capability in :model:`WSF_SAR_SENSOR <WSF_SAR_SENSOR>`.
  This is intended only for evaluation purposes.

* **(CR 6225)** Added the :method:`WsfFuel.CurrentMode` and :method:`WsfFuel.SelectMode` script methods to :class:`WsfFuel`.
