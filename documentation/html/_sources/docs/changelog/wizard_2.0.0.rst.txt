Wizard v2.0.0 - 25 March 2016
-----------------------------

New Features
============

* Added the :doc:`../wkf_plugin/wiz_demo_browser` capability.
* Added the Wizard_DIS_Interface_Setup plugin.
* Added new high-contrast, dark color theme.
* Added capability to dynamically discover, view, and select predefined color themes (cascading style sheets) via the Wizard_Options dialog.
* Added functionality to automatically re-style open editor tabs/windows upon change in theme or font/color options.
* Added functionality to dynamically discover and pre-populate the :doc:`../wkf_plugin/wiz_simulation_manager` upon first execution.
* Integrated :doc:`../wizard_command_documentation` with new Sphinx documentation system/paradigm, including duplication of look and feel.

Notes
=====

* Significant refactor/overhaul of Wizard menus and :doc:`../wizard_main_window` Toolbars, including correction of issues with context-based feature enabling/disabling.
* Migrated many core features (including Wizard_Map_Window, ***Wizard_Multi_Run***, etc.) into stand-alone plugins to ease development activities.

Bugs
====

* Fixed the ability to comment a selection with the shift+3 (#) key combination.
* Fixed the Map Window->Platform Properties->Name field always displaying " - multiple selection - " when an entity is selected. When a platform is selected, both the entity and its attachments are selected which was triggering a multi-select indication.
* Disabled the ability to open the Map Window without a project loaded. Interaction with the Map Window without a project loaded was causing Wizard to crash.
* Fixed mis-aligned line numbering on the :doc:`../wizard_find_results` dialog upon editing of matching file.
* Fixed mis-aligned breakpoint locations in the :doc:`../wkf_plugin/wiz_script_debugger` upon editing of file (Mantis Bug 29).
* Fixed incorrect population of "Externals Items" on the :doc:`../wkf_plugin/wiz_project_browser` and file path resolution when using the :command:`file_path` command (Mantis Bug 76).
* Corrected an issue with the Linux installation of the SigView executable not having correct user permissions. The CMAKE for Wizard ***SigView*** plug-in has been updated.
* Corrected an issue with the hardcoded background color (light grey) and the default text color (white) in Wizard dark made the auto pop-up intellisense  textboxes unreadable.  Changed the default text color to black so that it's readable.
* Corrected issues with new functionality to dynamically discover and pre-populate the :doc:`../wkf_plugin/wiz_simulation_manager` upon first execution. Changes include additional :doc:`Command Line Arguments <../wizard_command_line>`.
