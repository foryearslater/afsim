Wizard v0.1.0 - 03 January 2012
-------------------------------

Enhancements
============

* Wizard can now handle non-WSF files. Signature files, antenna pattern files, etc, are added to the project automatically.
* Added Save As menu option.
* WSF parsing is more complete, including most of RIPR.
* Added action to comment or uncomment the selection by either pressing the "#" key or using the "Edit" menu.
* Added "Open Recent Project" option.
* Added a "Start" page with convenient links for users.
* Editor tabs can now be dragged for reordering or creating separate windows.
* Added documentation for Wizard, accessible through the Help menu.
* Added a feature to select the target WSF application, allowing Wizard to understand application and version specific
  commands. This feature only applies to future release of WSF tools -- WSF 1.7.3 or later.
* Other small miscellaneous usability improvements.

Bugs
====

* Fixed a crash that occurred sometimes when typing the "include" command at the end of a file.
* Fixed problem where "Find" would behave unexpectedly. Merged "Find" and "Find in Files" dialogs.
* Fixed problem where drag & drop would not work for text.
* Fixed problem where "Find References" would produce a huge menu if too many results were found.
* Fixed a problem where loading an invalid grammar file would provide poor feedback and abort.

Feature Requests
================

* Save As should replace the current tab with the newly created file.
