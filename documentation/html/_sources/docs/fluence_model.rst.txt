Overview
========

The fluence model is utilized by :model:`WSF_LASER_WEAPON` and :model:`WSF_CUED_LASER_WEAPON` to calculate beam spread and beam
loss due to jitter, diffraction, atmospheric turbulence, extinction, and target effects.

.. note::
      The default method of calculating target geometry is to assume a head-on, maximally effective aspect. 
      This may be modified with a cosine rolloff with the use of the calculate_incidence_ input. 
      However, the best way to model the target geometry is with a :model:`WSF_INTERSECT_PROCESSOR` and the use of intersection
      meshes that represent the target geometry within the simulation.

.. _Fluence_Model.Fluence_Model_Types:

**<fluence-model-type-name>** Specifies one of the :ref:`Fluence Model Types <Fluence_Model.Fluence_Model_Types>`:

Commands
========

.. command:: aperture_diameter <length-value> 
   
   The aperture diameter of the HEL system.  Changing this parameter controls the diffraction-induced beam spread,
   affecting the beam size on target.  The larger the aperture diameter, the smaller the beam on target, and the greater
   the energy density (energy density ~ (aperture diameter^2)).

.. _fluence_model.atmospheric_structure:
.. include:: turbulence_commands.txt

.. command:: beam_quality <real-value> 
   
   Specify the beam quality of the optical system.  The beam quality is a measure of how close the profile is to a perfect
   gaussian.  Specifically it is a multiplicative factor times the diffraction-limited radius.  It varies from a value of
   1 (diffraction limited) to values of order unity (but still greater than one).
   
   **Default** 1.1

.. command:: calculate_incidence <boolean-value> 
   
   Specify whether to calculate an incidence angle on target based on aspect, with a head-on aspect to target representing
   the minimum (0 degree) incidence.  Any incidence greater than 90 degrees would be considered ineffective.

   **Default** *disabled*

   .. note::
      This feature has been superseded by use of intersection meshes and the :model:`WSF_INTERSECT_PROCESSOR`.

.. command:: jitter <angle-value> 
   
   Specify the jitter of the system (typically on the order of microradians).  The higher the jitter, the more a HEL beam
   will be "spread out" over the target.
   
   **Default** 6.6e-7

.. command:: laser_type  carbon_dioxide | nd_yag | coil | deuterium_fluoride 
   
   Specify the high-energy laser type.  In turn this specifies the wavelength, which is needed by the various models to
   calculate diffraction and extinction of the beam.

   .. note::
      Currently use of this command is preferred over wavelength_.

   .. note::
      This value, along with :command:`fluence_model.default.haze_model` and
      :command:`fluence_model.default.atmosphere_model` is used to load a table of :command:`atmospheric_coefficients` generated by
      ModTran.

.. command:: power <power-value> 
   
   This is the actual laser power emitted from the aperture.

.. command:: wavelength <length-value> 
   
   The wavelength at which the laser operates (e.g., 1.064 microns for a Nd-YAG laser).  Current supported wavelengths (in
   nanometers) include

   * 1000 (Carbon Dioxide)
   * 1064 (Nd:YAG)
   * 1315 (COIL- Iodine Lasing)
   * 3800 (Deuterium Fluoride)

   .. note::
      This value, along with :command:`fluence_model.default.haze_model` and
      :command:`fluence_model.default.atmosphere_model` is used to load a table of :command:`atmospheric_coefficients` generated by
      ModTran.

   .. note::
      See the "hel_demo" example directory in the standard release for the necessary files corresponding
      with these atmosphere models.
