| This demo is an example of a script to control a WSF_AIR_MOVER altitude over terrain.
|
| The key points:
|    It creates a geopoint ahead of you based on the speed of your body and gets
|    future height above terrain.
|
|    It chooses two vertical rates to choose based on the severity of the
|    altitude delta coming up.
|
|    It has a upper and lower (hysteresis) boundary so commanded altitude isn't
|    constantly changing with every on_update.
|
|    It keeps the route it is on and only changes altitude.
|
|    It does not check for negative altitudes so it could possibly fly under
|    ground if an altitude delta was too large.
|
|    It does not do terrain avoidance.
