WsfTargetOffsetFrame
--------------------

.. class:: WsfTargetOffsetFrame

The :class:`WsfTargetOffsetFrame` provides a means to select the frame in
which offsets are specified in :class:`WsfTargetPoint` objects.

.. note:: This class is being replaced by :class:`WsfOrbitalReferenceFrame` and is only used in deprecated methods of :class:`WsfTargetPoint`. The use of this class is deprecated, and it will be removed in a future release.

Static Methods
==============

.. method:: WsfTargetOffsetFrame RIC()

   Return a :class:`WsfTargetOffsetFrame` instance representing the RIC frame.

   The RIC frame uses an x-axis (Radial) along the position of
   the target point, a z-direction (Cross-track) aligned with the orbital angular
   momentum of the target, and a y-direction (In-track) that completes the
   right-handed orthonormal frame.

.. method:: WsfTargetOffsetFrame NTW()

   Return a :class:`WsfTargetOffsetFrame` instance representing the NTW frame.

   The NTW frame uses an x-axis along the velocity vector of the target point,
   a z-axis perpendicular to and in the same plane as the target's nadir vector,
   and a y-axis that completes the right-handed orthonormal frame.
