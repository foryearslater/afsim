WsfManeuverConstraint
---------------------

.. class:: WsfManeuverConstraint

Overview
========

Maneuver constraints specify the conditions under which a maneuver will begin
executing, and when a maneuver will be considered to be completed. A constraint
can be executed multiple times during the lifetime of a maneuver. Each 
:class:`WsfManeuver` can support one entry and one exit constraint.

Creation Methods
================

.. method:: WsfManeuverConstraint AT_TIME(double aTime)

   Return a constraint that will become satisfied only once the given 
   absolute time is reached.

.. method:: WsfManeuverConstraint AT_RELATIVE_TIME(double aRelativeTime)

   Return a constraint that will become satisfied the given time after the
   assignment time of the constraint. The assignment time of the constraint is
   the time at which the associated maneuver becomes pending (for an entry
   constraint) or completing (for an exit constraint). 

.. method:: WsfManeuverConstraint AT_ROLL_ANGLE(double aRollAngleDeg)

   Return a constraint that will become satisfied when the platform to which the
   maneuver associated with this constraint is assigned reaches a certain roll
   angle in degrees.

.. method:: WsfManeuverConstraint AT_PITCH_ANGLE(double aPitchAngleDeg)

   Return a constraint that will become satisfied when the platform to which the
   maneuver associated with this constraint is assigned reaches a certain pitch
   angle in degrees.

.. method:: WsfManeuverConstraint AT_HEADING(double aHeadingDeg)

   Return a constraint that will become satisfied when the platform to which the
   maneuver associated with this constraint is assigned reaches a certain
   heading in degrees.

.. method:: WsfManeuverConstraint AT_ALTITUDE(double aAltitudeMeters)

   Return a constraint that will become satisfied when the platform to which the
   maneuver associated with this constraint is assigned reaches a certain 
   altitude in meters.

.. method:: WsfManeuverConstraint AT_FLIGHT_PATH_ANGLE(double aPathAngleDeg)

   Return a constraint that will become satisfied when the platform to which the
   maneuver associated with this constraint is assigned reaches a certain
   flight path angle in degrees.

.. method:: WsfManeuverConstraint SCRIPT(string aSatisfied, string aNextEvaluation)

   Return a constraint that will use the named user-supplied scripts in the 
   global context to perform the work of the constraint. The first script
   will be executed to determine if the constraint is satisfied. If not, then
   the second script will be executed to determine the next time to perform the
   evaluation test. Both scripts need to take two arguments: the first, a
   double, is the assignment time of the constraint; the second, a
   :class:`WsfP6DOF_Mover` is the mover to which the associated maneuver is
   assigned. The first script should return a boolean value indicating if
   the constraint is satisfied. The second script should return a double
   giving the time that the constraint should next be evaluated.

   For example, to reproduce the behavior of the constraints returned by
   :method:`WsfManeuverConstraint.AT_RELATIVE_TIME`, one could use the
   following scripts:

   ::

      script_variables
         double aRelativeTime = 3.0;
      end_script_variables

      script bool AtRelativeTimeEvaluator(double aAssignTime, WsfP6DOF_Mover aMover)
         return TIME_NOW >= aAssignTime + aRelativeTime;
      end_script

      script double AtRelativeTimeNextEvaluation(double aAssignTime, WsfP6DOF_Mover aMover)
         return aAssignTime + aRelativeTime;
      end_script

      ...

      WsfManeuverConstraint constraint = WsfManeuverConstraint.SCRIPT("AtRelativeTimeEvaluator", "AtRelativeTimeNextEvaluation");

      ...

General Methods
===============

.. method:: string Type()

   Return the type of the constraint.
