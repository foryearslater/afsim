WsfChaffWeapon
--------------

.. class:: WsfChaffWeapon inherits WsfWeapon

Overview
========
WsfChaffWeapon_ provides a script interface to a chaff weapon for dropping parcels of chaff. 

.. warning::
   Since WsfChaffWeapon inherits from WsfWeapon, all methods on WsfWeapon are available, but :method:`WsfWeapon.Fire` will not 
   dispense chaff as intended because no ejector is specified. Instead, use :method:`DropChaffCloud <WsfChaffWeapon.DropChaffCloud>` below.

Methods
=======

.. method:: bool DropChaffCloud(int aNumberParcels, double aDropInterval, Array<string> aEjectorList)

   Drop a chaff cloud consisting of a number of parcels dispensed from each of the ejectors named in aEjectorList. The time separation
   in seconds between parcels in the cloud is specified by aDropInterval. Each ejector named in aEjectorList must be a valid ejector
   defined on the :model:`WSF_CHAFF_WEAPON`. Returns true if successful, otherwise false for a variety
   of reasons, such as an ejector is undefined, the quantity of parcels remaining in an ejector is 0, or the weapon has exceeded the 
   maximum number of active salvos allowed (one salvo per ejector).
