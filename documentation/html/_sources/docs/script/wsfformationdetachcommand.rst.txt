WsfFormationDetachCommand
-------------------------

.. class:: WsfFormationDetachCommand inherits WsfFormationCommand

:class:`WsfFormationDetachCommand` is a command that will detach the formation
to which it is assigned from its parent. Unlike :class:`WsfFormationAttachCommand`,
this will not modify the attachment status of sub-formations of the
formation to which the command is assigned. In the case that the leader of the
formation was keeping station, the leader will instead change to flying level
in a constant direction.
