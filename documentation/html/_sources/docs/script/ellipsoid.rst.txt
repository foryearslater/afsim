Ellipsoid
---------

.. class:: Ellipsoid

:class:`Ellipsoid` provides a 3D representation of an ellipsoid that can be viewed with :class:`WsfDraw` (typically, to visualize track covariances [see :method:`WsfCovariance.EllipsoidNED`]).  Class methods provide the three principal semi-axis lengths and the euler angles that transform the ellipsoid into an NED coordinate frame.

Methods
=======

.. method:: double SemiAxisForward()
   
   Return the semi-axis of the ellipsoid along the principal (non-rotated) x-axis.
   
.. method:: double SemiAxisSide()
   
   Return the semi-axis of the ellipsoid along the principal (non-rotated) y-axis.
   
.. method:: double SemiAxisUp()
   
   Return the semi-axis of the ellipsoid along the principal (non-rotated) z-axis.
   
.. method:: double OrientationRoll()
   
   Return the ellipsoid's NED-referenced roll angle.
   
.. method:: double OrientationPitch()
   
   Return the ellipsoid's NED-referenced pitch angle.
   
.. method:: double OrientationHeading()
   
   Return the ellipsoid's NED-referenced heading angle.
