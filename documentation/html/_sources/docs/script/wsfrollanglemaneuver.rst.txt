WsfRollAngleManeuver
--------------------

.. class:: WsfRollAngleManeuver inherits WsfManeuver

Overview
========

This maneuver sets the target roll angle of the platform to which it is
assigned. This maneuver is done executing as soon as the target is set, so if 
there is a need to wait for the achieved roll angle to reach the target
value, a :class:`WsfManeuverConstraint` must be used.

Methods
=======

.. method:: WsfRollAngleManeuver Construct(double aRollAngleDeg)

   Construct a maneuver that will set a target roll angle on the platform to
   which the maneuver is assigned.

.. method:: double GetRollAngle()

   Return this maneuver's target roll angle in degrees.
