WsfOrbitalConjunctionReport
---------------------------

.. class:: WsfOrbitalConjunctionReport

:class:`WsfOrbitalConjunctionReport` contains the details of conjunctions
predicted by a :model:`WSF_ORBITAL_CONJUNCTION_PROCESSOR`.

Methods
=======

.. method:: double MissDistance()

   Return the predicted distance in meters between the two objects at the time 
   of closest approach.

.. method:: double RelativeVelocity()

   Return the predicted relative velocity in meters per second of the two 
   objects at the point of closest approach.

.. method:: double StartTime()

   Return the predicted time in seconds when the two objects enter within their 
   mutual exclusion zone.

.. method:: double EndTime()

   Return the predicted time in seconds when the two objects leave their mutual 
   exclusion zone.

.. method:: double MinimumTime()

   Return the predicted time in seconds of the point of closest approach of the
   two objects.

.. method:: double MaximumProbability()

   Return the predicted maximum probability of the conjunction.

.. method:: string Primary()

   Return a text identifier of the primary object suffering the predicted 
   conjunction.

.. method:: string Secondary()

   Return a text identifier of the secondary object suffering the predicted
   conjunction.
