WsfSixDOF_FormationManeuverLimitsCommand
----------------------------------------

.. class:: WsfSixDOF_FormationManeuverLimitsCommand inherits WsfSixDOF_FormationCommand

:class:`WsfSixDOF_FormationManeuverLimitsCommand` can be used to set various limits
on the maneuvers that the member platforms of the formation to which it is
assigned will perform. Depending on options selected, this command can
also reset the limits to the default values for the mover in question. To set
limits on all the members of a formation, execute this command on the 
top-level formation containing all of the members whose limits should be
modified.

Methods
=======

.. method:: static WsfSixDOF_FormationManeuverLimitsCommand Construct()

   Construct a command that will reset the limits on the member platforms of
   the formation to which it is assigned. If limits are set using the other
   methods on this object, this command will no longer reset the limits to the
   default, but will instead set the selected limits, leaving the other limits
   as they are.

.. method:: static WsfSixDOF_FormationManeuverLimitsCommand Construct(double aMaxPitchG_Load, double aMaxRollRate, double aMaxBankAngle)

   Construct a command that will reset the max pitch g-load, the max
   roll rate (in degrees per second) and the max bank angle (in degrees) for
   the member platforms of the formation to which this command is assigned.

.. method:: void SetMaxPitchG_Load(double aMaxPitchG_Load)

   Set the limit on pitch g-load that will be applied by this command. If no
   limit is set for this command, then the limit will not be modified on the
   member platform. Setting this limit has no effect on the other limits that
   can be set.

.. method:: double GetMaxPitchG_Load()

   Return the limit on the pitch g-load that will be applied by this command.

   .. note:: If no pitch g-load limit has been set, the returned value will not reflect the operation of the command.

.. method:: void SetMaxBankAngle(double aMaxBankAngle)

   Set the limit on bank angle that will be applied by this command. If no
   limit is set for this command, then the limit will not be modified on the
   member platform. Setting this limit has no effect on the other limits that
   can be set.

.. method:: double GetMaxBankAngle()

   Return the limit on max bank angle in degrees that will be applied by this command.

   .. note:: If no bank angle limit has been set, the returned value will not reflect the operation of the command.

.. method:: void SetMaxRollRate(double aMaxRollRate)

   Set the limit on roll rate that will be applied by this command. If no
   limit is set for this command, then the limit will not be modified on the
   member platform. Setting this limit has no effect on the other limits that
   can be set.

.. method:: double GetMaxRollRate()

   Return the limit on roll rate in degrees per second that will be applied by this command.

   .. note:: If no roll rate limit has been set, the returned value will not reflect the operation of the command.
