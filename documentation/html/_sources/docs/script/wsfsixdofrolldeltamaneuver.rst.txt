WsfSixDOF_RollDeltaManeuver
---------------------------

.. class:: WsfSixDOF_RollDeltaManeuver inherits WsfSixDOF_Maneuver

Overview
========

This maneuver sets a target change in roll angle for the platform to which it
is assigned. This maneuver is done executing as soon as the target is set, so if 
there is a need to wait for the achieved change in roll angle, a
:class:`WsfSixDOF_ManeuverConstraint` must be used.

Methods
=======

.. method:: static WsfSixDOF_RollDeltaManeuver Construct(double aRollDeltaDeg)

   Construct a maneuver that will set a target change in roll angle for the
   platform to which the maneuver is assigned.

.. method:: double GetRollDelta()

   Return this maneuver's target change in roll angle.
