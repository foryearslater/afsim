WsfSensorInteraction
--------------------

.. class:: WsfSensorInteraction inherits WsfEM_Interaction

Methods
=======

.. method:: bool Detected()
   
   Returns 'true' if sensor EM interaction resulted in a detection of the target. (Pd >= Required Pd) and there were no
   other failure reasons.

.. method:: string ModeName()
   
   Returns the name of the sensor mode used during the EM interaction.

.. method:: int BeamNumber()
   
   Returns the index of the beam within the beam list that resulted in the best probability of detection for the EM
   interaction.

.. method:: double Pd()
   
   Returns the probability of detection.

.. method:: double RequiredPd()
   
   Returns the probability of detection required for detection.
