WsfOrbitalReferenceFrame
------------------------

.. class:: WsfOrbitalReferenceFrame

The :class:`WsfOrbitalReferenceFrame` provides a means to select among the
available reference frames for some script methods.

Static Methods
==============

.. method:: WsfOrbitalReferenceFrame INERTIAL()

   Return a :class:`WsfOrbitalReferenceFrame` instance representing the inertial reference frame.
   This frame is usually the :ref:`ECI` frame, but may represent the equivalent frames around
   other central bodies when used in the context of a space domain platform that is being
   propagated around a central body other than the Earth.

.. method:: WsfOrbitalReferenceFrame RIC()

   Return a :class:`WsfOrbitalReferenceFrame` instance representing the RIC frame.

   The Radial, In-track, Cross-track (RIC) is a reference frame defined relative to a given position and
   velocity, which are often taken from the current state of a platform.
   The frame uses an x-axis (Radial) along the position of
   the target point, a z-direction (Cross-track) normal to the orbital plane (i.e., aligned with the
   orbital angular momentum of the target), and a y-direction (In-track) that completes the
   right-handed orthonormal frame. The In-track direction will be in the same general direction
   as the given velocity, though it will only be parallel to the given velocity vector in certain
   situations.

   When used for relative positions or velocities, the origin of the RIC frame coincides with the
   given position or velocity.

.. method:: WsfOrbitalReferenceFrame NTW()

   Return a :class:`WsfOrbitalReferenceFrame` instance representing the NTW frame.

   The NTW frame uses an x-axis along the velocity vector of the target point,
   a z-axis perpendicular to x and in the same plane as the target's nadir vector,
   and a y-axis that completes the right-handed orthonormal frame.
