WsfPursueManeuver
-----------------

.. class:: WsfPursueManeuver inherits WsfRelativeManeuver

Overview
========

This relative maneuver will cause the executing platform to fly onto the target's
path a given distance ahead of the target platform.

When it is executing, this maneuver predicts the future motion of the target
platform and provides control to the executing platform that has the effect
of flying toward a certain location relative to that predicted target motion.
In addition to the control limits this class inherits from
:class:`WsfRelativeManeuver`, the distance ahead of the target to which the
executing platform will fly can be controlled by the user.
