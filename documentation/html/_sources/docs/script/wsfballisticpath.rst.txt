WsfBallisticPath
----------------

.. class:: WsfBallisticPath inherits Object
   :constructible:
   :cloneable:

WsfBallisticPath provides a representation of a ballistic path that is initialized and updated with
:class:`tracks <WsfTrack>` and provides extrapolation, trajectory visualization (with :class:`WsfDraw`), and estimates of impact
point and impact time.

Methods
=======

.. method:: bool Update(WsfTrack aTrack)
   
   Update the ballistic path based on the location and velocity contained in the track.

.. method:: bool HasData()
   
   Return whether the object has valid data.

.. method:: void Draw(WsfDraw aDraw)
   
   Draw the ballistic trajectory using the given :class:`WsfDraw` object.

.. method:: bool IsBallisticType(string aTypeName)
   
   Return whether the provided type is a ballistic type (registered using the :command:`ballistic_types` input).

.. method:: WsfGeoPoint ImpactPoint()
   
   Provide the projected impact point for the object's computed trajectory.

.. method:: double ImpactTime()
   
   Return the projected simulation impact time for the object's computed trajectory.

.. method:: WsfGeoPoint PointAtTime(double aSimTime)
   
   Provide the projected point along the object's trajectory at the given simulation time.
