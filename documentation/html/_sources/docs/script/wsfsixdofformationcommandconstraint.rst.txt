WsfSixDOF_FormationCommandConstraint
------------------------------------

.. class:: WsfSixDOF_FormationCommandConstraint

Creation Methods
================

.. method:: WsfSixDOF_FormationCommandConstraint AT_TIME(double aSimTime)

   Create an absolute time command constraint. A :class:`WsfSixDOF_FormationCommand`
   given the constraint that results from this method will begin executing at 
   the given simulation time.

.. method:: WsfSixDOF_FormationCommandConstraint AT_RELATIVE_TIME(double aTimeToStart)

   Create a relative time command constraint. A :class:`WsfSixDOF_FormationCommand`
   given the constraint that results from this method will begin executing
   after the given number of seconds past the time at which the command is 
   assigned to a formation.

Other Methods
==============

.. method:: double GetConstraintTime()

   Return the time at which the constraint will be satisfied. If this constraint
   was created with AT_TIME(), this will be the absolute time. If this
   constraint was created with AT_RELATIVE_TIME(), this will return the 
   relative time if the command has not been assigned, and the absolute time
   if the command has been assigned.

.. method:: double SetConstraintTime()

   Set the absolute time for the constraint. If this constraint was created
   with AT_RELATIVE_TIME(), after calling this method, it will be as if it
   had been created with AT_TIME().
