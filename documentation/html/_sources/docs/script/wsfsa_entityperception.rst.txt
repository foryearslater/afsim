WsfSA_EntityPerception
----------------------

.. class:: WsfSA_EntityPerception
   :constructible:
   :cloneable:

Overview
========

The :class:`WsfSA_EntityPerception` provides a representation of a perceived entity, which may be a platform (asset) or track (bogie/bandit). Entity perceptions are a key component of the situation awareness component of the cognitive model, provided by the :class:`WsfSA_Processor`.

Entity perceptions are used within the "perception" and "assessment" modules of the :class:`WsfSA_Processor` (SAP). The SAP uses these entity perceptions to form various lists.

The first group of lists involve assets (friendly), bogies (unknown), and bandits (enemy). These lists are not prioritized, although they may be limited due to range and/or scoring parameters when limited perception is enabled.

The next group of lists provide an assessment of the prioritized threats and targets, which are composed of bandits and bogies. These lists are prioritized, from highest threat to lowest threat and from the best target to the least attractive target. Threats are perceived entities that present an adverse condition (a threat) to the platform, while targets are perceived entities that the platform may wish to attack.

In addition, the SAP provides lists of perceived groups (:class:`WsfSA_Group`), and each group may contain a list of :class:`WsfSA_EntityPerception` that make up the "elements" of the group.

Entity perceptions may be perceived as a missile. The default assumption, however, is that an entity is an aircraft. Thus, it is quite possible that an entity may actually be a missile, but is not yet perceived as such.

Methods
=======

.. method:: int EntityPlatformIndex()

   Returns the index of the entity platform. This may be zero (0) if the true platform is unknown.

.. method:: WsfTrack Track()

   Returns the WsfTrack of the group. Use :class:`IsValid() <Object>` to verify value returned.

.. method:: double Lat()

   Returns the latitude (deg) of the entity.

.. method:: double Lon()

   Returns the longitude (deg) of the entity.

.. method:: double Altitude()

   Returns the altitude (meters) of the entity.

.. method:: double Bearing()

   Returns the bearing (deg) of the entity.

.. method:: double Speed()

   Returns the speed (meters/sec) of the entity.

.. method:: double Heading()

   Returns the heading (deg) of the entity.

.. method:: double ThreatLevel()

   Returns the threat level of the entity. This is a normalized value between 0.0 and 1.0.

.. method:: double TargetValue()

   Returns the target value of the entity. This is a normalized value between 0.0 and 1.0.

.. method:: double Risk()

   Returns the risk posed by the entity. This is a normalized value between 0.0 and 1.0.

.. method:: double Defensiveness()

   Returns the defensiveness induced by the entity. This is a normalized value between 0.0 and 1.0.

.. method:: double Urgency()

   Returns the sense of urgency imposed by the entity. This is a normalized value between 0.0 and 1.0.

.. method:: string IdString()

   Returns the id string of the entity.

.. method:: int PerceivedIndex()

   Returns the perceived platform index of the entity.

.. method:: string PerceivedName()

   Returns the perceived platform name of the entity.

.. method:: string PerceivedType()

   Returns the perceived platform type of the entity.

.. method:: int FlightId()

   Returns the flight id of the entity.

.. method:: string IdFlag()

   Returns the id flag of the entity.

.. method:: int Identification()

   Returns the identification of the entity.

.. method:: bool FriendlyAsset()

   Returns true if the entity is a friendly asset.

.. method:: bool AngleOnly()

   Returns true if the entity is defined by an angle-only track.

.. method:: bool IdIffFriend()

   Returns true if the entity has been identified as friendly via IFF.

.. method:: bool IdIffFoe()

   Returns true if the entity has been identified as foe (enemy) via IFF.

.. method:: bool IdIffNeutral()

   Returns true if the entity has been identified as neutral via IFF.

.. method:: bool IdIffUnknown()

   Returns true if the entity has not been identified via IFF.

.. method:: bool IdAuxFriend()

   Returns true if the entity has been identified as friendly via aux data.

.. method:: bool IdAuxFoe()

   Returns true if the entity has been identified as foe (enemy) via aux data.

.. method:: bool IdAuxNeutral()

   Returns true if the entity has been identified as neutral via aux data.

.. method:: bool IdAuxUnknown()

   Returns true if the entity has not been identified via aux data.

.. method:: bool IdSideFriend()

   Returns true if the entity has been identified as friendly via side data.

.. method:: bool IdSideFoe()

   Returns true if the entity has been identified as foe (enemy) via side data.

.. method:: bool IdSideNeutral()

   Returns true if the entity has been identified as neutral via side data.

.. method:: bool IdSideUnknown()

   Returns true if the entity has not been identified via side data.

.. method:: bool IdTypeFriend()

   Returns true if the entity has been identified as friendly via type data.

.. method:: bool IdTypeFoe()

   Returns true if the entity has been identified as foe (enemy) via type data.

.. method:: bool IdTypeNeutral()

   Returns true if the entity has been identified as neutral via type data.

.. method:: bool IdTypeUnknown()

   Returns true if the entity has not been identified via type data.

.. method:: bool IsHostile()

   Returns true if the entity has been identified as hostile.

.. method:: bool IsMissile()

   Returns true if the entity is perceived as a missile.

.. method:: bool AltitudeValid()

   Returns true if the entity altitude is valid.

.. method:: bool SpeedValid()

   Returns true if the entity speed is valid.

.. method:: bool HeadingValid()

   Returns true if the entity heading is valid.

.. method:: double SelectionScore()

   Returns the current selection score of the entity.

.. method:: double EstimatedTimeToIntercept(WsfPlatform aTarget)

   Returns the estimated time for this entity to intercept the specified target platform.
   If no intercept is possible, -1.0 is returned.
   If the entity is angle-only, or if it lacks speed data, no intercept will be calculated and -1.0 will be returned.
