WsfSixDOF_FormationManager
--------------------------

.. class:: WsfSixDOF_FormationManager

The :class:`WsfSixDOF_FormationManager` provides the primary means to interact with
the lifetimes of :class:`WsfSixDOF_Formation` objects in simulations. The following
methods are all static, and can be accessed from any script context.

Formation Query Methods
=======================

.. method:: WsfSixDOF_Formation GetFormation(string aQualifiedName)

   Given the fully qualified name of a formation, this method will return the
   formation with that name. If there is no such formation, then this method
   will return an invalid object.

.. method:: bool HasFormation(string aQualifiedName)

   Returns true if the simulation has a formation with the given qualified
   name.

.. method:: Array<WsfSixDOF_Formation> GetTopLevelFormations()

   Returns an array containing all of the current top-level formations.

.. method:: Array<WsfSixDOF_Formation> GetAllFormations()

   Returns an array containing all of the current formations.

Formation Creation Methods
==========================

.. method:: WsfSixDOF_Formation CreateUnit(string aName)

   This will create a new unit formation with the given name. A unit formation
   cannot have any sub-formations, but can have a member platform assigned to
   it. This method can fail if there is already a formation with the given 
   name; in this case it will return an invalid object.

.. method:: WsfSixDOF_Formation CreateSection(string aName)

   This will create a new section with the given name. A section is a formation
   that can have two sub-formations, each of which is a unit. This method will
   return an invalid object if there is already a formation with the given
   name.

.. method:: WsfSixDOF_Formation CreateFormation(string aName)

   This will create a new formation with the given name. This will produce the
   most general sort of formation, with no restrictions on the number or kinds
   of sub-formations. This method will return an invalid object if there is
   already a formation with the given name.

.. method:: WsfSixDOF_Formation CreateFormation(string aType, string aName)

   This will create a formation of the given type with the given name. The
   available types of formation are 'unit', 'section' and 'formation'. If there
   is no such type, or if there is already a formation with the given name,
   this method will return an invalid object.

Formation Destruction Methods
=============================

.. method:: bool DisbandFormation(string aName)

   This will disband the formation with the given name. Disbanding a formation
   will destroy that formation and all its descendant sub-formations. When
   destroyed, a formation will not destroy the platforms that were members of
   the various unit formations part of the disbanded formation. The state of
   the member platforms will also no longer be subject to update by the
   formation or the commands executed on the formations.

   This method only works on top-level formations. So if a sub-formation is to
   be disbanded, first remove that sub-formation from its parent, and then
   disband the removed formation.
