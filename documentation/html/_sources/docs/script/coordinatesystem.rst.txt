CoordinateSystem
----------------

.. class:: CoordinateSystem

CoordinateSystem classes are currently used to define an :class:`OrbitalState` class, and have
two possible types: equatorial and ecliptic.

Static Methods
==============

.. method:: CoordinateSystem Equatorial()

   Constructs a :class:`CoordinateSystem` object based on the equatorial coordinate system.
   The central body's equatorial plane defines the X and Y axes in a right-handed rectangular system.

.. method:: CoordinateSystem Ecliptic()

   Constructs a :class:`CoordinateSystem` object based on ecliptic coordinate system.
   This coordinate system is defined by an origin at the center of the central body, and a plane
   consisting of the projection of the Sun's apparent path onto the celestial sphere.
