WsfLocalTrack
-------------

.. class:: WsfLocalTrack inherits WsfTrack
   :cloneable:
   :constructible:

WsfLocalTrack represents a platforms local perception of an object, and is the combination of one or more
contributing :class:`WsfTrack` objects. The contributing tracks are sometimes called 'raw' tracks and represent the products
of a sensor or some other platform.


Methods
=======

.. method:: int RawTrackCount()

   Return the number tracks that are contributing to this track. Contributing tracks are also called "raw' tracks.

.. method:: WsfTrackId RawTrackId(int aTrackIndex)

   Return the selected track ID from the list of contributing tracks, where 0 <= aTrackIndex < RawTrackCount().

.. method:: WsfTrack RawTrack(int aTrackIndex)

   Return the selected track from the list of contributing tracks, where 0 <= aTrackIndex < RawTrackCount().


Auxiliary Data Methods
======================

.. include:: ../scriptauxdata.txt

..          void SetAuxData(string aName, bool aValue, bool aPropagateToRawTracks)
            void SetAuxData(string aName, int aValue, bool aPropagateToRawTracks)
            void SetAuxData(string aName, double aValue, bool aPropagateToRawTracks)

   Set the value of the auxiliary data attribute with the indicated name. If "aPropagateToRawTracks' is true the value
   will also be set into the auxiliary data of all the contributing tracks.


Contributor Methods
===================

.. method:: bool ContributorOf(WsfPlatform aPlatform)
            bool ContributorOf(WsfPlatform aPlatform, WsfSensor aSensor)

   Returns 'true' if raw tracks from a given platform are contributing to this local track. All sensors are considered
   unless a given sensor is supplied.

.. method:: bool SensorTypeContributor(string aSensorType)

   Returns 'true' if raw tracks from a given sensor type are contributing to this local track.

.. method:: int NumContributors()

   Returns the number of platforms contributing to this local track.

.. method:: Array<WsfTrack> RawTracksFrom(WsfPlatform aPlatform)

   Returns the list of raw tracks contributed from aPlatform.

.. method:: WsfTrack RawTrackFromSensorName(WsfPlatform aPlatform, string aSensorName)

   Returns a track contributing to this local track detected by aPlatform's sensor with aSensorName.  Returns null if no
   track was found.

.. method:: WsfTrack RawTrackFromSensorType(WsfPlatform aPlatform, string aSensorType)

   Returns a track contributing to this local track detected by aPlatform's sensor with type aSensorType.  Returns null if
   no track was found.  If multiple raw tracks fit this criteria, the most recent track is returned.  aSensorType must be
   the sensor's direct type, as in:

   ::

    platform...
     sensor sensor-name <u>sensor-type</u>
     ...
