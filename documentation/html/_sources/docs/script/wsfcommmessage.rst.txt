WsfCommMessage
--------------

.. class:: WsfCommMessage inherits Object

Description
===========

This script class provides access to the WsfCommMessage_ object, which is a container for a standard :class:`WsfMessage`.
This object is typically used internally to the comm framework in AFSIM, but is occasionally exposed to provide the
additional data used by the comm framework in the script context.

Methods
=======

.. method:: Array<WsfAddress> GetTraceRoute()

   Provides the traceroute of the current address. Every comm interface a message is transmitted from to reach its final
   destination adds its address to the traceroute within the comm framework. This provides that history of which interfaces
   this message has passed through up until the time of this call.

   Note that the traceroute does not contain the address for an interface that has not yet transmitted a message, such that
   if the traceroute is being inspected on the originator interface, this traceroute will be empty.

.. method:: int GetTTL()

   Provides the number of hops (time-to-live) for this message, as set by the message's originating router interface.
   Any potential path to a destination that exceeds the TTL value will not reach its destination using that path, and will
   be dropped.

.. method:: WsfMessage GetSourceMessage()

   Provides the :class:`WsfMessage` object being held by this container.
