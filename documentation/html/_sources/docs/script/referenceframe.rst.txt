ReferenceFrame
--------------

.. class:: ReferenceFrame

ReferenceFrame classes are currently used to define an :class:`OrbitalState` class, and have four
possible options: inertial, J2000, true of date, and true equator, mean equinox (TEME).

Static Methods
==============

.. method:: ReferenceFrame Inertial()

   Constructs a :class:`ReferenceFrame` object based on an inertial coordinate
   frame. In the case of an Earth central body, this becomes an Earth-centered inertial coordinate
   frame (ECI). This reference frame is useful to describe the motion of celestial bodies and spacecraft.

.. method:: ReferenceFrame J2000()

   Constructs a :class:`ReferenceFrame` object based on the J2000 inertial reference frame, defined
   with the Earth's mean equinox at 12:00 Terrestial Time, January 1, 2000.

.. method:: ReferenceFrame TRUE_OF_DATE()

   Constructs a :class:`ReferenceFrame` object based on the True of Date reference frame, defined
   such that the XY plane is the central body's true of date equator.

.. method:: ReferenceFrame TEME()

   Constructs a :class:`ReferenceFrame` object based on the True Equator, Mean Equinox (TEME) quasi-inertial reference frame, used for the
   NORAD two-line elements.
