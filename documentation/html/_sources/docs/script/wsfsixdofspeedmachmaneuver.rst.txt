WsfSixDOF_SpeedMachManeuver
---------------------------

.. class:: WsfSixDOF_SpeedMachManeuver inherits WsfSixDOF_Maneuver

Overview
========

This maneuver sets a target speed on the platform to which the maneuver is
assigned. This maneuver uses mach number as its measure of
speed. This maneuver is done executing as soon as the target speed is set,
so if there is a need to wait for the achieved speed, a
:class:`WsfSixDOF_ManeuverConstraint` must be used.

Methods
=======

.. method:: static WsfSixDOF_SpeedMachManeuver Construct(double aMachNumber)

   Construct a maneuver that will set a target mach number for the platform to 
   which the maneuver is assigned.

.. method:: double GetMach()

   Return this maneuver's target mach number.
