WsfCommGraphNode
----------------

.. class:: WsfCommGraphNode

Description
===========

The :class:`WsfCommGraphNode` represents a node in a :class:`WsfCommGraph`. In the comm framework, graphs
are used to represent network states, routing tables, etc. A node in such a graph represents an individual
comm interface in the graph, and is uniquely identified by its address.

Methods
=======

.. method:: WsfAddress GetAddress()

   Returns the assigned address to this node in the graph.

.. method:: bool IsEnabled()

   Returns true if this node is set to be enabled in the graph, or false if disabled. In general, most
   pathing decisions made in the comm framework do not consider a node (or any of its edges) if disabled.
