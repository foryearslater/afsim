WsfFlightPathAngleManeuver
--------------------------

.. class:: WsfFlightPathAngleManeuver inherits WsfManeuver

Overview
========

This maneuver sets the target flight path angle of the assigned
platform. This maneuver is done executing as soon as the target is set, so if 
there is a need to wait for the platform's flight path angle to reach the target
value, a :class:`WsfManeuverConstraint` must be used.

Methods
=======

.. method:: WsfFlightPathAngleManeuver Construct(double aFlightPathAngleDeg)

   Construct a maneuver that will instruct the assigned platform to obtain the
   given flight path angle in degrees.

.. method:: double GetFlightPathAngle()

   Return this maneuver's target flight path angle.
