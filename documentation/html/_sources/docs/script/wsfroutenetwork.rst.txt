WsfRouteNetwork
---------------

.. class:: WsfRouteNetwork inherits WsfObject

Static Methods
==============

.. method:: WsfRouteNetwork FindRouteNetwork(string aRouteNetworkName)
   
   Returns the route network with the given name.

Methods
=======

.. method:: WsfRoute GeneratePathOffRouteToRoute(double aStartLatitude, double aStartLongitude, double aEndLatitude, double aEndLongitude)
            WsfRoute GeneratePathOffRouteToRoute(WsfGeoPoint aStartPoint, WsfGeoPoint aEndPoint)
   
   Finds the shortest path on a route network given any starting and ending points.  If the start or end points are off of
   the network, the shortest path to get onto the network is computed first.

.. method:: WsfRoute GeneratePathOnRoute(WsfGeoPoint aStartPoint, WsfGeoPoint aEndPoint)
   
   Finds the shortest path on a route network given any starting and ending points.  If the start or end points are off of
   the network, the returned route will get as close as possible to the end point without leaving the route network.

.. method:: WsfGeoPoint SnapToNearestSegment(WsfGeoPoint aPoint)
   
   Returns a :class:`WsfGeoPoint` at the closest location to aPoint along any segment of the route network.

.. method:: WsfGeoPoint SnapToNearestWaypoint(WsfGeoPoint aPoint)
   
   Returns a :class:`WsfGeoPoint` at the location of the route network's waypoint closest to aPoint.

.. method:: Array<WsfRoute> Routes()
   
   Returns an array containing all routes in the route network.  The routes returned in this way should not be modified.
