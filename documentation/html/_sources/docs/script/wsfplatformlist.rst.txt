WsfPlatformList
---------------

.. class:: WsfPlatformList
   :container: 

:class:`WsfPlatformList` is a container of references to :class:`WsfPlatform` objects. Platform lists are returned by many script
types including:

* :method:`WsfPlatform::Peers <WsfPlatform.Peers>`
* :method:`WsfPlatform::Subordinates <WsfPlatform.Subordinates>`

In addition to the methods described below, the container may be processed using the **foreach** script language
statement as follows:

.. parsed-literal::

   :class:`WsfPlatformList` platformList = <a method that returns a :class:`WsfPlatformList`>;
   foreach (:class:`WsfPlatform` p in platformList)
   {
      # ...Code to process the :class:`WsfPlatform` object referenced through the variable 'p'...
   }

Methods
=======

.. method:: int Count()
            int Size()
   
   Returns the number of entries list.
   
.. method:: bool Empty()

   Returns true if the list is empty.
   
   .. note:: This is faster than checking for Count() != 0.

.. method:: WsfPlatform Entry(int aIndex)
            WsfPlatform Get(int aIndex)
   
   Returns the entry at the given index, which must be in the range [ 0 .. Count()-1 ].
   
   .. note::
   
      The Get method allows the entries to be accessed via array indexing: e.g::
   
         WsfPlatform p = platformList[i];
      
.. method:: Iterator WsfPlatformListIterator GetIterator()
   
   Returns an iterator that points to the beginning of the list. This is used by the script language to support the **foreach** command but may also be used directly.
