WsfScriptedDynamicsTerm
-----------------------

.. class:: WsfScriptedDynamicsTerm inherits WsfOrbitalDynamicsTerm

Overview
========

The :class:`WsfScriptedDynamicsTerm` represents a user-scriptable dynamics
term to implement dynamics that are not build into AFSIM. See also
:ref:`Scripted Term <orbital_dynamics_terms.scripted>`.

Static Methods
==============

.. method:: WsfScriptedDynamicsTerm Construct(string aScriptName)

   Construct a scripted dynamics term that uses the script with the given name
   to compute the acceleration. The named script must return a :class:`Vec3`
   and accept the following arguments in order: a :class:`WsfIntegratingSpaceMover` giving
   the mover that this term is affecting, a double giving the mass of the platform
   at the time of the script execution, a :class:`Calendar` giving the time at
   which the dynamical term is being computed, a :class:`Vec3` giving the
   position of the platform, and a :class:`Vec3` giving the velocity of the
   platform.

Methods
=======

.. method:: string ScriptName()

   Return the name of the script that computes the acceleration for this term.

.. method:: Vec3 ComputeAcceleration(double aMass, Calendar aTime, Vec3 aPosition, Vec3 aVelocity)

   For the :class:`WsfScriptedDynamicsTerm` this method will return the zero
   vector; the acceleration provided by this term can only be computed when the
   dynamics are fully initialized and are in use by a :class:`WsfIntegratingSpaceMover`.
