   Examples::

       System.Command("dir *.txt > files.txt");

       # Write time and date to file
       System.Command("time /T > date.txt");
       System.Command("date /T >> date.txt");

       # Read file and print to screen
       FileIO dateFile = FileIO();
       dateFile.Open("date.txt");
       writeln(dateFile.Readln(), " ", dateFile.Readln());
