WsfOrbitalDynamics
------------------

.. class:: WsfOrbitalDynamics

Overview
========

The :class:`WsfOrbitalDynamics` represents the chosen dynamics for a
:class:`WsfIntegratingSpaceMover`. A dynamics is conceptually a series of
:class:`WsfOrbitalDynamicsTerm` objects, each of which contributes to the
total acceleration.

Methods
=======

.. method:: int NumTerms()

   Return the number of :class:`WsfOrbitalDynamicsTerm` objects that make up these
   dynamics.

.. method:: WsfOrbitalDynamicsTerm Term(int aIndex)

   Return the term at the given index. The provided index should be in the
   range [0, N), where N is the return value from :method:`WsfOrbitalDynamics.NumTerms`.

.. method:: void AddTerm(WsfOrbitalDynamicsTerm aTerm)

   Add the given term to these dynamics.

.. method:: bool RemoveTerm(int aIndex)

   Remove the term at the given index. If the term is successfully removed, this
   will return true. If there is some problem, such as the provided index being
   out of range, this will return false.

.. method:: Vec3 ComputeAcceleration(double aMass, Calendar aTime, Vec3 aPosition, Vec3 aVelocity)

   Compute the acceleration for these dynamics on an object with the given mass,
   position and velocity at the given time.
