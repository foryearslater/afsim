Permission Manager - Warlock
============================

.. image:: images/warlock_permission_manager.png

The Permission Manager dialog displays information about ability of the user to modify Warlock and the simulation.  This allows a wargame lead to control which teams are visible and which platforms a user may control.

How to Use
----------

The Permission manager dialog can be accessed via the Options menu within Warlock.  Once the wargame lead has selected the desired permissions, use the Save button to save a permissions file.  To load a permission file, use the :doc:`command line option<warlock_command_line>`  "-permission_file <filename>".  

.. note:: When a permission file is loaded, the user will be unable to modify permissions.

Permissions
-----------

Permissions are split into different categories.

Sim Controller

* Enable Simulation Control - This controls whether the user can control the simulation which includes Pause, Run, Restart, and actions that control time.

Platform Controller

* Restrict Platform Creation and Deletion - This controls whether a user is allowed to create new platforms or delete existing platforms.
* Limit Platform Control to Team - If this option is enabled, a user will only be able to control/modify platforms on the specified team.
* Limit Platform Control to List - If this option is enabled, a user will only be able to control/modify platforms whose name in the list.

General

* Lock File Loading - This prevents the user from navigating the file system either to open or save a file.
* Lock Team Visibility - This prevents the user from being able to change what team is visible.

Plugins
-------

Plugins may provide additional permissions and those will be displayed within the Permission Manager dialog.
