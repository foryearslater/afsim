| UNCLASSIFIED
| Any resemblance or approximations to actual weapon system capabilities 
| in this demo are purely accidental.  The intent of this DEMONSTRATION is 
| to illustrate how to setup an integrated air defense system (IADS).

| There are two start up files.
| The startup file "orwaca_northern_area.txt"  only has the sams in the states of Washington and Oregon.
| The startup file "orwaca_full_area.txt" has the additional SAMs located in the state of California

| You must use the new icons that have "_icon" in the name or all of the platforms will look like stop signs when 
| looking at output files in Mystic.

| The "orwaca_full_iads_coverage.JPG" image file (located in jpg subdirectory) shows the geographical locations 
| of the sam sites.
| The extremely long range sams (ELR_SAMS) are 175 nautical mile missiles (RED rings)
| The long range sams (LR_SAMS) are 100 nautical mile missiles (ORANGE rings)
| The medium range sams (MR_SAMS) are  50 nautical mile missiles (GREEN rings)
| The  SR_SAMS are  10 nautical mile missiles (VIOLET rings) (max alt of 15kft)
    (they don't do so well past 7 nautical miles so can be defeated at longer kinematic ranges)
| The SR_SAMS (telars) are self commanded and do not do cooperative engagements like the longer range sams.

| The TBM shooting at Denver can be adjusted to shoot at any time during the simulation run.
| This can be accomplished by adjusting the times in platforms/tbm_launcher_vehicle.txt (for every tbm launcher) OR 
| adjusting the platform variables in the scenario file "tbm_route_launch.txt". 
| This is just an example to show some scripting capability.  The pause time in the route has to be adjusted accordingly.
