Overview
========

:model:`WSF_UNCLASS_ASSET_MANAGER` is the script class for the
HELIOS-based IADS C^2 asset manager model port. It is meant to be used in
concert with the battle managers for providing common IADS status,
track, and assignment interfaces. An asset manager is responsible for 
reporting its own status, receiving the status of its subordinate 
units, and reporting an aggregate status. In addition, the asset 
manager (and its subsystems) performs weapon-to-target assignment 
for tracks stored by the unit, and will also monitor and assess 
existing assignments.

Script Interface
================

:model:`WSF_UNCLASS_ASSET_MANAGER` utilizes capabilities of the
:ref:`Common_Script_Interface`, :model:`WSF_SCRIPT_PROCESSOR`, and
:model:`WSF_ASSET_MANAGER`.

Unclassified Asset Manager Commands
===================================

The Unclassified asset manager model doesn't add any functionality above
what is provided by the :model:`WSF_ASSET_MANAGER` base class.
