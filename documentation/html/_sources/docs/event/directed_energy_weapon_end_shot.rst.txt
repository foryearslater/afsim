Breakdown
=========

<time>
    current simulation time
<event>
    simulation event recorded in this message
<firing platform>
    name of firing platform
<target platform>
    name of target platform.  If the target has already been killed or removed from the
    simulation, the message "(Target Not in Simulation)" will appear instead.
<target offset>
    name of target offset (if any)
<weapon name>
    name of the directed energy weapon that is firing
<weapon type>
    type of directed energy weapon that is firing
<target type>
    target platform's type
<N> <E> <D>
    The location of the target with respect to the firing platform in local
    North-East-Down coordinates. These data will only be present if the target has not
    been killed / removed from the simulation.
<range> <bearing> <elevation>
    The location of the target with respect to the firing platform in range, bearing,
    and elevation.  These data will only be present if the target has not been killed /
    removed from the simulation.
<power>
    power on target
<peak irradiance>
    irradiance at the center of the beam
<edge irradiance>
    irradiance at the damage radius
<damage radius>
    the radius within which the beam is effective.  This is the bucket size for power
    in the bucket calculations
<energy density>
    the energy density (fluence) on target for this shot
<energy>
    the energy on target for this shot
<semi-major axis>
    the longitudinal beam size on target, measured from the peak to the point at which
    irradiance is1/e.  This will be the beam spot size divided by the cosine of the
    incidence angle.
<semi-minor axis>
    the transverse beam size on target, measured from the peak to the point at which
    irradiance is 1/e.
