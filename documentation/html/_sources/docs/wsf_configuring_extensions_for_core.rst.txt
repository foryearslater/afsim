WSF Build Instructions: For configuring extensions for core
-----------------------------------------------------------

The "Descriptions" section describe locations, as opposed to environment/cmake/other variables, and are used to help you
understand where change and configuration are needed. A windows path referencing style is used below, however, a very
similar structure will work for unix systems as well.


Assumptions:

* WSF software is already installed on your machine.  If this is not the case, please see WSFInstallInstructions.rst.

Descriptions:

* BUILD_DIRECTORY_ROOT: The top-level directory where all software is stored.
* WSF_CORE_ROOT_DIR : The location where WSF software is installed.  The top-level directory should be named Core.
  Core's immediate subdirectories are wsf_core, wsf_package, dis, etc...
* EXTENSION_ROOT_DIR : The root location for your extension software.  All CMake, source, headers, etc... exist in 1+
  subdirectories underneath.  wsf_module and wsf_cmake_extension.cmake will reside here.
* EXTENSION_SUB_DIR : The directory name, where your extension software will be provided.  This directory is a
  sub-directory of EXTENSION_ROOT_DIR.  In the example below, this directory is simply named source.
* wsf_module : A file that will be required in order for your project to be included in WSF cmake processing. This file
  does not require any content within it, and will not process content within.
* wsf_cmake_extensions.cmake : A file that is required, and must be configured, in order for your project to be included
  in WSF cmake processing.
* EXTENSION_NAME : The name of your extension.  This information must be assigned by you inside
  wsf_cmake_extensions.cmake.
* EXTENSION_SOURCE_DIR : The location of your extension's primary CMakeLists.txt file, relative from the location of
  wsf_cmake_extensions.cmake.  This information must be assigned by you inside wsf_cmake_extensions.cmake.
* CMAKE_BUILD_FILES_DIR : The location where CMake build files will be sent.
* WSF_PACKAGE_CMAKE_DIR : The location of the CMakeLists.txt file that lives in the wsf_package project.
* MY_EXTENSION_BUILD_FILES_DIR: The location of the resulting build files for your software.

Checklist:

* Leverage CMake to generate build files for your current project/solution.
* Create EXTENSION_ROOT_DIR, and place it inside of WSF_CORE_ROOT_DIR.
* Create EXTENSION_SUB_DIR inside of EXTENSION_ROOT.
* Add all of your project software to EXTENSION_SUB_DIR, including CMake files.
* Add wsf_module to EXTENSION_ROOT_DIR.
* Add wsf_cmake_extensions.cmake to EXTENSION_ROOT.
* Provide the name of your extension, as a replacement for EXTENSION_NAME, inside wsf_cmake_extensions.cmake.
* Provide the location of your extension software's primary CMakeLists.txt file, relative from the location of
  wsf_cmake_extensions.cmake, inside wsf_cmake_extensions.cmake.
* If you have an extension configured with a previous version of WSF:

 * Compare the software that exists in your previous version of WSF to the software that exists in your new version of WSF.
 * For each difference between the previous WSF and the newest WSF that requires change/update of your software, complete the necessary change(s)/update(s).
 * If your new WSF software will be located in a different place than your previous WSF software, replace any absolute or relative directory path references to previous WSF software with appropriate path references to your new WSF software.

* If your software is not currently integrated with WSF

 * Incorporate the contents of CMakeLists_Support.txt (available in the Examples\Support directory) into your primary CMakeLists.txt file.

   .. note:: WSF will build the WSF libraries for you.

* Clear all conflicting CMake commands (i.e. configuration of output binary directory, output library directory, etc...)
  from your extension CMake files, so that they do not override WSF CMake configuration settings.
* Open a command prompt.
* Navigate to CMAKE_BUILD_FILES_DIR.
* Execute the following command (excluding quotes): "cmake WSF_PACKAGE_CMAKE_DIR" .
* Observe that CMake processing is complete.
* Inside the CMAKE_BUILD_FILES_DIR, observe that all of the appropriate build files have been generated, including those
  for your extension.
* Use your build tool (i.e. Visual Studio 2013) to open your desired solution (i.e. MyExtension.sln), and to identify
  your desired startup project.
* Choose a build configuration (i.e. Release), and successfully build your solution.
* Finished!

Support:

* A wsf_module file that you can leverage is located inside Core\wsf_core\Examples\Support.  This file is ready for use
  as-is.
* A wsf_cmake_extensions.cmake file that you can leverage is located inside Core\wsf_core\Examples\Support.  This file
  requires your configuration.
* The CMakeLists.txt file is located inside Core\wsf_core\Examples\Support.  The contents of this file (i.e. via copy
  and paste, or via this file's incorporation as a .cmake file) are ready for incorporation into your primary
  CMakeLists.txt file.

Examples:

1::

   A working example can be located in the WSF_CORE_ROOT_DIR\Examples\Integrate directory.

   Windows example of what the resulting directory structure should look like, given the assumptions stated below:
   Assumptions: 
   BUILD_DIRECTORY_ROOT = C:\WSF
   WSF_CORE_ROOT_DIR = C:\WSF\Core
   EXTENSION_ROOT_DIR = C:\MyExtension
   EXTENSION_SUB_DIR = C:\MyExtension\source
   EXTENSION_NAME = MyExtension
   EXTENSION_SOURCE_DIR = C:\MyExtension\source (note: In this example, this value is equivalent to EXTENSION_SUB_DIR, but this does not have to be the case.  The source can located elsewhere within the extension sub directory.)
   CMAKE_BUILD_FILES_DIR : C:\WSF\CMake_Build_Files
   WSF_PACKAGE_CMAKE_DIR : C:\WSF\Core\wsf_package
   MY_EXTENSION_BUILD_FILES_DIR: C:\WSF\CMake_Build_Files\build_MyExtension

Directory structure::

   C
      WSF
         Core
            ...
            dis
            ...
            wsf_core
            ...
            wsf_package
               CMakeLists.txt
            ...
         MyExtension
            source
               CMakeLists.txt
               *.hpp
               *.cpp
            wsf_module
            wsf_cmake_extension.cmake
         CMake_Build_Files
            build_MyExtension (note: this directory will not exist until after WSF CMake processing)

Associated content of wsf_cmake_extensions.cmake file::

   set(WSF_EXT_NAME <EXTENSION_NAME>)
   set(WSF_EXT_SOURCE_PATH <EXTENSION_SOURCE_DIR>)
