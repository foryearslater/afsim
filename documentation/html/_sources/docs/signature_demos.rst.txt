| This directory contains various examples and demonstrations of defining
| platform signatures and sensors to detect them.
|
| Following are the top-level files to be loaded and run in the AFSIM Wizard.

1st_composite_optical_signature_rocket.txt
------------------------------------------

| This example demonstrates using :model:`WSF_COMPOSITE_OPTICAL_SIGNATURE`
| to set and change the signature of a 2 stage rocket, using cone,
| cylinder, and plume shapes. The rocket is detected by 
| :model:`WSF_IRST_SENSOR` and :model:`WSF_EOIR_SENSOR` sensors throughout its trajectory.

2nd_composite_optical_signature_fighter.txt
-------------------------------------------

| This example demonstrates using :model:`WSF_COMPOSITE_OPTICAL_SIGNATURE`
| to set the signature of a simple fighter aircraft with different shapes.
| The shape impacts each fighter's projected areas, and thus detection events,
| with the sensor types :model:`WSF_IRST_SENSOR` and :model:`WSF_EOIR_SENSOR`.
