    This base effect type can be included in the :command:`electronic_protect` or
    :command:`electronic_attack` technique block as one of the many available effects for a given
    technique. The commands listed below are the base-type commands that can be specified in the effect block for this
    effect type.

    .. note::

        If :command:`_.receiver` and/or :ref:`Antenna_commands` are entered this will override the default use of a
        matched main and auxiliary channel receiver and/or antenna, respectively. In cases where these commands are used,
        parameters are not copied from the main channel receiver and/or antenna and all parameters of interest should be set by
        the user.

Commands
========

.. command:: auxiliary_antenna_pattern  <pattern-name> 
   
   Specifies the antenna pattern name to be used.

   .. note::
   
       This antenna pattern will become the only and default antenna pattern.
   
   .. note::
   
       This input will override (i.e., takes precedence over) the :command:`_.receiver`
       :command:`_.receiver.antenna_pattern`.

.. command:: auxiliary_beam_tilt  <angle-value> 
   
   Specifies the beam tilt of the auxiliary receiver. The default tilt is angle is derived from the receiver this effect
   is attached to if this is not defined.
   
   Default: :command:`_.receiver.beam_tilt` of the receiver for which the effect is attached

.. command:: blanking_threshold  <dbratio-value> 
   
   Specifies the blanking threshold level at which the signal will be blanked.
   Signal blanking will occur if the (auxiliary receiver channel)/(main channel power) >= blanking_threshold.
   
   Default: 0.0 dB

.. command:: main_jnr_thresholds  <min-db-ratio> <max-db-ratio> 
   
   Specifies the main channel JNR threshold levels to use as the lower and upper levels, respectively, at which the SLB
   will operate with the input jamming signal.
   
   Default: Main receivers SNR threshold as defined on the sensing receiver for the lower level and large value for the
   maximum upper level.

.. command:: auxiliary_jnr_thresholds  <min-db-ratio> <max-db-ratio> 
   
   Specifies the auxiliary channel JNR threshold levels to use as the lower and upper levels, respectively, at which the
   SLB will operate with the input jamming signal.
   
   Default: Main receivers SNR threshold as defined on the sensing receiver for the lower level and large value for the
   maximum upper level.

.. command:: saturation_effect  <saturation-type> ... end_saturation_effect 
   
   Input block to provide the saturation effect and it's associated input commands.

   **<saturation-type>** 
      Specifies the saturation type to be used. Available saturation effects are as follows:

       no_saturation_effect
            No saturation effects will be applied.
       duty_cycle_limit_effect
            Duty-cycle saturation effects will be applied. See saturation_duty_cycle for more
            information.
   
   Default: no_saturation_effect

.. command:: duty_cycle_limit  <value> 
   
   Specifies the maximum duty-cycle of the incoming jamming signal at which blanking will occur. Any jamming signal with a
   duty-cycle greater than this value will not be blanked (i.e., the blanker will not be operational). Valid values in
   range of [0..1].
   
   Default: 1.0

.. command:: target_blanking_effect  <target-blanking-type> ... end_target_blanking_effect 

Input block to provide the saturation effect and its associated input commands.

<target-blanking-type>
    Specifies the target blanking type to be used. Available target blanking effects are as
    follows:
   
       no_target_blanking_effect
           No saturation effects will be applied.
       duty_cycle_probability_effect
           Probability draw and comparisons to the incoming signal duty-cycle will be used
           for target blanking effects.
   
   Default: no_target_blanking_effect

.. command:: probabilities  ... end_probabilities 

Input block to provide a target blanking probability table effect and its associated input commands.

pulse_density <pulse-density> <probability-value>

duty_cycle <duty-cycle > <probability-value>
    Specifies the target blanking probability for the specified
    received pulse-density or duty-cycle from the jamming signal. Multiple entries create a lookup table.
