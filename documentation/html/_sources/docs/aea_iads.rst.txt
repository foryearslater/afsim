| This directory contains the necessary files to test the EW effects
| in a scenario similar to the iads_demo baseline scenario.
|
| The SOJ and EW_Radar have EA and EP techniques, respectively, with them
| to aid in the testing and verification of these techniques.
|
| The strike.txt file is the normal run input file to run the simulation
| as a single application.
|
| To execute, open "strike.txt" in Wizard and execute using the mission
| application. The replay file will written to the output directory for 
| opening by Mystic.
|
| Also included are two realtime run files strike-rt.txt and iads-rt.txt
| that can be run separately to test the jamming and EW effects over DIS.
| To run both concurrently, open two Wizard applications one with 
| "iads-rt.txt" and one with "strike-rt.txt" and execute using the mission
| application. Each WSF application communicate over DIS. The applications
| can be run on separate hosts or on the same host. The file dis_data.txt
| provides the DIS Enumeration mapping for the entity types, emitter types,
| and EW technique types.
|
| To visually monitor the progress of the realtime sims, Warlock can be opened
| and then setup to monitor multicast address 224.2.25.55, port 3225 via input
 file containing a dis_interface block.
