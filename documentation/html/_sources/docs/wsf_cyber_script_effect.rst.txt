Overview
========

:model:`WSF_CYBER_SCRIPT_EFFECT` is a cyber_effect that allows one to define the
effect using the scripting language.

.. note:: This effect does NOT require user supplied data during a CyberAttack initiation call.


Commands
========

.. command:: platform_type <type> ... end_platform_type

   Define the effect scripts for a platform type.
   This command may be repeated as necessary.

.. command:: platform <name> ... end_platform

   Define the effect scripts for a specific platform.
   This command may be repeated as necessary.

.. command:: default ... end_default

   Define the effect scripts for any victim that does is not specified by platform or platform_type.
   This command is only valid once, and multiple instances of this block will only use the last declared
   instance of this block.

.. _effect_scripts:

Effect Scripts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Two scripts must be defined to implement an effect:

.. parsed-literal::

   script void Attack(WsfCyberEngagement aEngagement)
   end_script

   script void Restore(WsfCyberEngagement aEngagement)
   end_script

The 'Attack' script is invoked when the attack has been determined that it will occur. The method should
take the necessary actions to cause whatever is needed to implement the effect.

The 'Restore' script is invoked when the it has been determined that the victim has recovered from the attack.
The method should take the necessary actions to rescind whatever actions were taken by the 'Attack' script
(essentially restoring the platform to the state that existed prior to the attack.)
