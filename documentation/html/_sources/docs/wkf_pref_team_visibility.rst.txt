The Team Visibility Preferences page controls which teams are visible and their assigned colors.

Teams can be added by typing a team name in the line edit and pressing Add Team. The Visible checkbox controls whether the team is visible to the users and the color controls what color is assigned to the team. A Team can be removed by selecting it and pressing the delete key.
