Overview
========

This base effect type can be included in the :command:`electronic_protect` or :command:`electronic_attack` technique block as one of the many available effects for a given technique. The commands listed below are the base-type commands that can be specified in the effect block for this effect type.

.. block:: WSF_POWER_EFFECT

Commands
========

.. command:: jamming_modulation_gain  <dbratio-value>

.. command:: modulation_gain  <dbratio-value>

   Specifies a mitigating adjustment to the effective jamming gain level created by this technique.  This adjustment modifies the normally-determined processed jamming power. If this input is specified within the system_type_data_ input block then it is specific to a system-type, otherwise this input is defined as the 'default' data to use for undefined system-types in the system_type_data_.

   Default: 0.0 dB

.. command:: jamming_to_signal_gain_table  ... end_jamming_to_signal_gain_table

.. command:: jamming_to_signal_gain_table  ... end_jamming_to_signal_gain_table

   This command provides the means to define a gain factor that is dependent on the J/S ratio, where J is the jamming power and S is the signal power in the receiver. Linear interpolation is used to derive the values for intermediate J/S ratios. J/S values outside the range of the table use the value from the appropriate endpoint (i.e., extrapolation is not performed). If this input is specified within the system_type_data_ input block then it is specific to a system-type, otherwise this input is defined as the 'default' data to use for undefined system-types in the system_type_data_.

   The format of the table is:

   .. parsed-literal::

       jamming_to_signal_gain_table
          jamming_to_signal <j_to_s-value-1> <gain-value-1>
          jamming_to_signal <j_to_s-value-2> <gain-value-2>
             ...
          jamming_to_signal <j_to_s-value-n> <gain-value-n>
       end_jamming_to_signal_gain_table

   The following rules must be observed:

   * The entries must be in order monotonically increasing J/S value.
   * There must be at least two entries.

.. command:: jamming_power_gain  <dbratio-value>

.. command:: power_gain  <dbratio-value>

   Specifies a mitigating adjustment to the effective jamming power level created by this technique.  This adjustment modifies the normally-determined physical jamming power. If this input is specified within the system_type_data_ input block then it is specific to a system-type, otherwise this input is defined as the 'default' data to use for un-defined system-types in the system_type_data_.

   Default: 0.0 dB

.. command:: signal_power_gain  <dbratio-value>

   Specifies a mitigating adjustment to the effective signal level created by this technique.  This adjustment modifies the normally-determined received signal power. If this input is specified within the system_type_data_ input block then it is specific to a system-type, otherwise this input is defined as the 'default' data to use for undefined system-types in the system_type_data_.

   Default: 0.0 dB

.. command:: receiver_noise_power_gain  <dbratio-value>

   Specifies a mitigating adjustment to the effective receiver noise power level created by this technique.  This adjustment modifies the normally-determined noise power with a multiplier that is applied for signal-to-noise calculations. If this input is specified within the system_type_data_ input block then it is specific to a system-type, otherwise this input is defined as the 'default' data to use for undefined system-types in the system_type_data_.

   Default: 0.0 dB

.. command:: system_type_data  <system-type-name> ... end_system_type_data

   Input block to provide the system type (e.g., SENSOR-TYPE, JAMMER-TYPE) specific data necessary to implement this technique for a given system type. Default data can be set up for system types not defined using the "default" string as the system type.

   .. parsed-literal::

      system_type_data_ <system-type-name>
         :model:`WSF_REPEATER_EFFECT` Commands
         :model:`WSF_RADIUS_EFFECT` Commands
         jamming_modulation_gain_ <db-ratio>
         jamming_power_gain_ <db-ratio>
         signal_power_gain_ <db-ratio>
         receiver_noise_power_gain_ <db-ratio>
      end_system_type_data

      *<system-type-name>*
         A string input of the system-type the following data applies to, valid values are **[system-type-name | "default"]**. Default data is used for unspecified system-types and if not defined no effect will be applied for the given system-type.

   .. note::

      This input is most often used by :command:`electronic_attack` definitions to specify different sensor-type data. It may be used by an :command:`electronic_protect` definitions to specify jammer-type data inputs, but most often data is just entered outside this input block and is applied against all jammer-types for :command:`electronic_protect` effects.
