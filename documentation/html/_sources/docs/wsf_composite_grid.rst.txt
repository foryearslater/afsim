Overview
========

The :model:`WSF_COMPOSITE_GRID` is a coverage grid defined by composing
sub-grids. This is useful for computing coverage over geographically separated
regions. These sub-grids can be of any available grid type
(see :doc:`predefined_coverage_grid_types`) that create their own platforms.
Each sub-grid defined must have a unique name among the sub-grids of this
grid. Sub-grids will inherit central_body_ and suppress_grid_platforms_ from
this grid. grid_data_file_ will be ignored on the sub-grids of this grid.

Commands
========

.. command:: subgrid <name> <grid-type> ... end_subgrid

   Add a sub-grid of the given **<grid-type>** with the given **<name>** to this
   grid. The subgrid_ is then configured according to the selected type, and will
   support any command that the selected grid type supports. The types of
   sub-grids supported are those that create their own platforms.
