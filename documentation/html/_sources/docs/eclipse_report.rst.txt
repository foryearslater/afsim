--------------

.. note:: The feature has been re-factored to the Post Processor. See Eclipse Report in the Post Processor documentation.

`Eclipse Report`_\s provide start time, end time, and the duration that platforms are within the Earth's shadow.

.. note:: Results do not take into account the effect of the oblate Earth or motion of the Earth during a single orbit of a platform.

Commands
========

.. command:: file_prefix

   Specify the output file prefix. The file extension is specified by the file_format_ command.

.. command:: file_format { csv | tsv }

   Specify the output file format, which must be either of *csv* (comma-separated variables) or *tsv* (tab-separated variables).

   **Default** csv

.. note:: 

   The **csv** file_format_ can be viewed in Microsoft Excel, but the formats for start and end times must be changed by selecting cells in the spreadsheet and using the *Format Cells...* option to select a compatible format (i.e., *m/d/yyyy h:mm.000* ).

.. command:: report { <platform> | all }

   Specify platform names for which eclipse events are to be reported in the output file.  The keyword *all* can be inserted, meaning that eclipse data will be computed for all orbiting platforms.
