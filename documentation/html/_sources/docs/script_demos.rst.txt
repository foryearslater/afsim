Basic Script Demo
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| This is a basic script example that demonstrates some the features
| of the scripting language and how to use scripting in an WSF component.
|
| The 'Comprehensive Script Demo' (script_demo_2.txt) builds upon this example.
|
| In this scenario we have:
| a) an air platform.
|
| The air platform will fly a route and print its configuration using a script.

Script Demo 2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| This is a script example that demonstrates many of the features
| of the scripting language. It is not a lesson in tactics.
|
| In this scenario we have:
| a) an air platform with a 'perfect' ESM device which gives the precise
|    location of an emitter.
| b) another air platform that is acting as a strike platform.
| c) a ground platform that is an enemy threat radar.
|
| The air platform will detect the threat radar and send a track to the striker
| which will drop bombs on it. The route is already planned for the striker.

Relative Geometry Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| This example demonstrates the syntax of the relative geometry method.

Script Demo 4
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| Demonstrates the various mover script commands available to users.

Script Demo 5
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| This is a script example that demonstrates many of the features
| of the scripting language. It is not a lesson in tactics.
|
| It is similar to Script Demo 2, however, it incorporates logic to "fly to" a
| target location and bomb the target. The route to the target is not
| hard coded as in Script Demo 2.
|
| In this scenario we have:
| a) an air platform with a 'perfect' ESM device which gives the precise
|    location of an emitter.
| b) another air platform that is acting as a strike platform.
| c) a ground platform that is an enemy threat radar which turns on after 5
|    min.
| d) In addition, a processor is added to the weapon to print information about
|    the trajectory on the way to the target.
|
| The air platform will detect the threat radar and send a track to the striker
| which will drop bombs on it.
