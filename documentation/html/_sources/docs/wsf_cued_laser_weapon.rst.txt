Overview
========

WSF_CUED_LASER_WEAPON_ is an implementation of :model:`WSF_LASER_WEAPON` that is cued by a separate
:model:`beam director <WSF_BEAM_DIRECTOR>`.  This beam director model is a sensor that acquires HEL targets and ensures that
the HEL is capable of firing at them..  Once the weapon is fired, the beam director attempts to cue to the targeted
region of interest.  The weapon only commences high energy lasing once the beam director cue is in constraints, which
include image size, gimbal rates, and target occlusion).  If the cue is lost for any reason, HEL lasing ceases, and the
target cue must be re-acquired by the beam director.

.. note::

   It is sufficient to define a the WSF_CUED_LASER_WEAPON_ and :model:`WSF_BEAM_DIRECTOR` on the same
   platform; the weapon will automatically find and link with the beam director. Specifying a
   beam director using the beam_director_ command is also possible.

Commands
========

.. command:: beam_director <string>

   Specifies a :model:`WSF_BEAM_DIRECTOR` object to attach to this cued laser weapon. When specified, the cued laser
   weapon will search for a beam director on the same platform with the specified name. If the beam director is found, the weapon will link to it. If
   the beam director is not found on the platform, initialization will fail.

.. command:: use_default_beam_director

   Disables the ability to specify a :model:`WSF_BEAM_DIRECTOR` to link the WSF_CUED_LASER_WEAPON_ with. When this command is used,
   the laser will not search for the :model:`WSF_BEAM_DIRECTOR` specified by the beam_director_ command, instead linking to the first
   :model:`WSF_BEAM_DIRECTOR` it encounters.
