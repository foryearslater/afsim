ballistic_types
---------------

.. command:: ballistic_types .. end_balistic_types
   :block:

.. parsed-literal::

   ballistic_types_
      use_fires_extrapolation_ <boolean>
      target_data_ <type>
         aero_ <aero-type>
         mass_ <mass-value>
      end_target_data
   end_ballistic_types

Overview
========

Ballistic_types defines a list of platform types that should be treated as ballistic projectiles.  This means that
BallisticPaths can be generated for these types, and special WsfDraw effects are generated for WeaponFired and
WeaponTerminated events.

Specify the WSF platform types that should be treated as ballistic types.  For example::

  ballistic_types
     FIRES_60MM_MORTAR
     FIRES_107MM_ROCKET
     FIRES_120MM_ARTILLERY
  end_ballistic_types

Commands
========

.. block:: ballistic_types

.. command:: use_fires_extrapolation <boolean>

   When creating BallisticPaths, directs whether to extrapolate using an existing WSF_FIRES_MOVER, if present.  If not
   present, or if the flag is set false, the path will be computed from target_data_, if available.

   **Default** true

.. command:: target_data <type> ... end_target_data
   
   Provide mass and aero characteristics associated with the given ballistic type.  These data are needed to calculate
   BallisticPaths when the use_fires_extrapolation flag is disabled.
   For example::

      ballistic_types
         ...
         target_data FIRES_122MM_ROCKET
            aero 122mm_ROCKET_AERO
            mass 66 kg
         end_target_data
         ...
      end_ballistic_types

   If one defines ballistic target data, it is not necessary to list the type again on a separate line.

.. block:: ballistic_types.target_data

.. command:: aero <aero-type>

   Provide aero characteristics associated with the given type.

.. command:: mass <mass-value>
   
   Provide a mass to be associated with the given type.
