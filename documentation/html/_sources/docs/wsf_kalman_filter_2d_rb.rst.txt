Overview
========

Defines a kalman filter for filtering tracks.  The filter converts the measurement's range and bearing data into a X-Y
position.

.. block:: WSF_KALMAN_FILTER_2D_RB

Commands
========

.. command:: debug
   
   Writes debugging information to the standard output.

.. command:: range_measurement_sigma <range-value>
   
   Defines the standard deviation that is applied to the measurement's range prior to filtering.

.. command:: bearing_measurement_sigma <angle-value>
   
   Defines the standard deviation that is applied to the measurement's bearing prior to filtering.

.. command:: process_noise_sigmas_XY <X-value> <Y-value>
   
   Defines the filter's noise standard deviation for the two directions.  The values must be entered in meters.
