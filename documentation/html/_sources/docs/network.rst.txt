Overview
========

The network command defines a user-specified network in the AFSIM communications environment.
Networks are auto-generated by comm definitions in AFSIM, unless explicitly instantiated in the
scenario input by using this command. All networks defined by the network command are instantiated
and available for assignment of comms to these networks by using the network name, or an address if
one was provided for the network. Networks not provided a specific address will be given a
dynamically assigned address with CIDR value of 24 for 254 assignable comms objects.

Commands
========

.. command:: network_address <address>

   If specified, assigns the network to the provided address. The number of assignable objects
   to this address will also be defined by the address CIDR value. The address provided for this
   network must not collide with any other network or reserved addresses.
