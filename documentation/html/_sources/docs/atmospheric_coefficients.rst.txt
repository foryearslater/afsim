Atmospheric coefficients are required when using a :command:`fluence_model` with a :model:`WSF_LASER_WEAPON` or
:model:`WSF_CUED_LASER_WEAPON`.  Typically, these are produced from ModTran for the given wavelength, haze model, and
atmosphere model.  There are currently data for the standard :command:`laser types <fluence_model.laser_type>` in the
hel_demo\atmosphere folder in the WSF standard release, version :ref:`wsf_1.7.5` and above; these are the
following:

* Carbon Dioxide        1000 nm
* ND-YAG                1064 nm
* COIL                  1315 nm
* Deuterium Fluoride    3800 nm

the following atmosphere models are supported from the ModTran,
Models 2,3, and 6 are supported for WSF at wavelength 1064;
otherwise only model 2 is supported at other wavelengths.

#. Tropical Atmosphere
#. Midlatitude Summer (default)
#. Midlatitude Winter
#. Subarctic Summer
#. Subarctic Winter
#. 1976 U.S. Standard

The following haze values are supported;
Currently all models are only available for wavelengths 1000 and 1064 (CO2 and Nd-YAG)
otherwise only model 1 is available (see model extraction procedure, below.
to access other models at other wavelengths).

#. RURAL Extinction, VIS = 23 km (Clear) (default)
#. RURAL Extinction, VIS = 5 km (Hazy)
#. Navy maritime Extinction
#. MARITIME Extinction, VIS = 23 km
#. Urban Extinction, VIS = 5 km

.. command:: altitude  ... end_altitude
   
   A list of altitudes for which corresponding attenuation and scattering coefficient blocks are provided.

.. command:: attenuation  ... end_attenuation
   
   A list of attenuation coefficients in units of 1/m.  Each entry in this block corresponds with the entry in the
   altitude_ block.

.. command:: scattering  ... end_scattering
   
   A list of scattering coefficients in units of 1/m.  Each entry in this block corresponds with the entry in the
   altitude_ block.

.. command:: wavelength <length-value> 
   
   The wavelength at which the table is valid.

.. command:: haze_model <integer-value> 
   
   The haze model used, corresponding with one of the values above (1-5).  This should be the same value used as input to
   the ModTran run.

.. command:: atmosphere_model <integer-value> 
   
   The atmosphere model used, corresponding with one of the values above (1-6).  This should be the same value used as
   input to the ModTran run.
